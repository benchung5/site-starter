							<h2>Sensible guidance for using plant and herbal information</h2>
							<p>If you have a health condition, take medications, are pregnant or nursing, or plan to use herbs regularly, speak with a qualified healthcare professional before using herbs in medicinal amounts.</p>
							<p>If you’re using a topical product (salve, oil, cream, etc.), consider doing a small patch test first and wait to see if your skin reacts.</p>
							<p>Be extra cautious with children and babies—don’t give herbal remedies in medicinal amounts without professional guidance.</p>
							<p>“Natural” doesn’t always mean “safe.” Use moderation, double-check plant identification, and avoid overdoing any remedy.</p>
							<p>Stop using any product or herb if you notice an unwanted reaction, and seek help if needed.</p>
							<p>Enjoy learning—stay curious, be careful, and use common sense.</p>
