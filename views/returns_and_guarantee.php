						<h2>Our Guarantee</h2>
						<p>We want you to succeed in establishing your garden ambitions! If plants don't make it through the mail due to delivery delays or adverse weather conditions, we will replace them or refund the order. Liability is limited to the cost of seed or plants when purchased. No other guarantee is expressed or implied. We will do our best to provide instruction for successful transplaning and germination of seeds. We can't guarantee all seeds and plants will grow as expected but feel to contact us, we may be able to help!</p>

						<h2>Returns and Replacements</h2>
						<p>All claims for replacements, credit, or refund must be received <b>within 60 days upon receiving the of delivery of your plants</b>. To submit a claim please email info@naturewithus.com and attach your order number, applicable photos, and describe your planting and method of care. <b>*Photos are needed within 48 hours of receiving your plant order</b>. If there is a possibility that the plants may survive, we may ask you to monitor your plants for two weeks, after which time we will provide compensation for any that do not recover. If we see a replacement is needed, we will attempt to ship the same plant species again. After the 60 day period, various environmental conditions take effect and we aren't able to provide refunds, replacements, or credits. We also aren't able to provide refunds, replacements, or credits for plants or seeds that have already been replaced. Thank you for your understanding!</p>

						<p>*When ordering, Please be sure to correctly enter your shipping address and any delivery instructions applicable. If a package is returned to us due to faulty address, we can only resend it if in good condition and an additional shipping fee will apply. It's a shame when customers enter the wrong address, and don't get their plants/seeds on time!</p>
