    [body] => <p>A North American countryside tree known for its hight and unique overarching habit.
Dutch Elm Disease has driven the American Elm to near extinction, changing Its average lifespan from 400 to under 100 years.</p>

<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Dark green with uninteresting yellow, green or brown fall colour. Short, stiff hairs on the upper surface causes it to have a rough, sand paper-like texture. The leaf base is usually unequal.</p>

<h3>Twigs & Buds</h3>
<p>Buds slant to one side. The bark of trunk has deep ridges and grooves.</p>

<h3>Pests & Disease</h3>
<p>Dutch Elm Disease is a fungus that attacks the tree's vascular system and it has killed almost all American Elms in North America. The Elm Bark Beetle is it's vector, spreading fungus spores from infected trees to healthy ones. An anti-fungal injection can be used every two years as a preventative.</p>
<p>Winnipeg, Manitoba has managed to protect its elms, cold weather kills the beetles, and the province has been adamant at preventing the disease there.</p>
<p>Some American Elms have developed a natural resistance to Dutch Elm Disease. The University of Guelph has taken advantage of these survivors and is creating seedlings Elms resistant to the Disease.</p>

    [body] => <p>Belongs to the red oak section and closely resembles the Scarlet Oak or Quercus Coccinea. Its straight central leader, pollution tolerance and ease of transplanting make the Pin Oak ideal for the urban landscape. A unique, vertically radial branching direction occurs on older trees.</p>

<p>The Pin Oak tolerates a variety of soil conditions but prefers moist to wet ground reflecting its native lowlands habitat in Niagara and the eastern United States. Soil with an acidic ph is required. Ferric ammonium citrate may be added as a last resort to non-acidic soil.</p>

<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Shinny, dark-green leaves with potential for nice red, yellow or brown fall colour. Lobes are pointy with lots of space between them. 5-7 lobes per leaf.</p>

<h3>Flowers & Fruit</h3>
<p>Acorns are small, with a tiny cap on top.</p>

<h3>Pests & Disease</h3>
<p>Gouty Oak Gall is caused by parasitic wasps laying eggs in the bark. Galls form which can be unsightly but cause minimal damage to the tree.</p>

A soft-needled tree known for it's height and graceful horizontal branches. Its shape is compact and pyramidal when young, changing to a loose and open habit when older. Eastern White Pine are the tallest trees in Ontario and Eastern North America. They are abundant in the wild and are often used in the landscape. Provided proper drainage, the tree can grow in a variety of soils, but is salt sensitive.
<p>

<h3>Needles & Branches</h3>
<p>
Long, flexible needles consisting of 5 needles per fascicle. It is the only 5 needled pine in eastern Canada. Weak branches break off easily, contributing to its top-branch dominance on older trees.
</p>

<h3>Cones</h3>
<p>
Long, cylinder cones with splotches of white resin when mature. They also make good fire starters.
</p>

<h3>Wood</h3>
<p>
The wood is light weight and easy to work with. It also provides good structure and doesn't shrink and swell. Useful for carpenters as well as building homes and outdoor structures. Algonquin park was almost all white pine at one point before early settlers harvested the wood for their ships.
</p>

<h3>Disease</h3>
<p>
White Pine Blister Rust (fungus) affects Eastern White Pine trees mainly in the forest. The Blister Rust needs plants of the genus 'Ribes' (Currents, Gooseberries) nearby to complete its lifecycle.
</p>

<h3>Popular Cultivars</h3>
<ul>
<li>'Pendula' - weeping
<li>'Niagara Falls' - sprawling
<li>"Vanderwolf's Green Globe" - globe-shaped
</ul>

A scale-leafed evergreen tree native to Ontario and Niagara. The Eastern White Cedar can grow to be very old in the wild (over 1000 years). Some of the oldest specimens are located in the Niagara escarpment. The tree is a natural mosquito repellent and grows alongside the White Pine and White Birch. the wood is stable, resistant to warping, shrinking and rot. As one of the most popular evergreen hedges in Canada, there are many cultivars. These have a shorter lifespan, averaging 50 to 150 years old.
</p>

<h3>Stems & Scales</h3>
<p>
Scale-like foliage, arranged in flat sprays. Scales consists of a facial leaf (at the tip) and lateral leaves.
</p>

<h3>Cones</h3>
<p>
In the shape of woody tulips when mature
</p>

<h3>Historical Facts</h3>
<p>
When Pioneers caught scurvy in early Montreal, the natives gathered branches from White Cedar trees to make a tea for them. The vitamin C from the branches ended up saving their lives. This contributed to the botanical name "Arbor" (tree) - "vitae" (life).
</p>

<h3>Pests</h3>
<p>
The occasional Cedar Leaf Miner can give the tree an unattractive appearance but is not very harmful. Treatment is done by pruning off affected branches.
</p>

<h3>Popular Cultivars</h3>
<ul>
<li>'Emerald' - compact and dense with no pruning required. Grows 12-15ft tall
<li>'Smargd' - a German cultivar and the most popular
<li>'Holmstrup' - about 15ft tall and 5ft wide with a pyramidal shape
<li>'Sunkist' - golden yellow new growth, 6-7ft tall and 4-5ft wide
<li>'Woodwardii' - globe-shaped cultivar 8ft tall and 8ft wide

    [body] => <p>A common forest, and occasional street tree Native to Ontario and the Niagara region. The American Linden is known for its large, heart-shaped, serrated leaves. Its fragrant flowers in Spring attract bees and other pollinators. The wood is light and very evenly and grained making it ideal for carving. All parts of the tree are edible edible including the buds, leaves, bark and flowers. Medicinal benefits from the Linden include treatment for colds, fever, cough, high blood pressure, headaches and many other ailments.</p>

<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Large, dark green leaves, 5-6" long. The colour is pale yellow in the fall. Tea can be made from them 
to reduce stress, help with digestion and detoxify the body.</p>

<h3>Twigs & Buds</h3>
<p>Red, tear-drop shaped, edible buds with 2 bud scales.</p>

<h3>Flowers & Fruit</h3>
<p>White, bee-friendly, fragrant flowers in late June to early July. Seed dormancy lasts 2-5 years making it difficult to grow from seed.</p>

<h3>Insects & Disease</h3>
<p>Lots of foliage feeding insects including aphids and Japanese Beetles can cause partial defoliation.
Leaf gall can cause appearance issues with minimal harm to the tree.</p>

    [body] => <p>A North American countryside tree known for its hight and unique overarching habit.
Dutch Elm Disease has driven the American Elm to near extinction, changing Its average lifespan from 400 to under 100 years.</p>

<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Dark green with uninteresting yellow, green or brown fall colour. Short, stiff hairs on the upper surface causes it to have a rough, sand paper-like texture. The leaf base is usually unequal.</p>

<h3>Twigs & Buds</h3>
<p>Buds slant to one side. The bark of trunk has deep ridges and grooves.</p>

<h3>Pests & Disease</h3>
<p>Dutch Elm Disease is a fungus that attacks the tree's vascular system and it has killed almost all American Elms in North America. The Elm Bark Beetle is it's vector, spreading fungus spores from infected trees to healthy ones. An anti-fungal injection can be used every two years as a preventative.</p>
<p>Winnipeg, Manitoba has managed to protect its elms, cold weather kills the beetles, and the province has been adamant at preventing the disease there.</p>
<p>Some American Elms have developed a natural resistance to Dutch Elm Disease. The University of Guelph has taken advantage of these survivors and is creating seedlings Elms resistant to the Disease.</p>

<h3>Popular Cultivars</h3>
<ul>
 <li>'Accolade' - hybrid with the Japanese Elm and resistant to Dutch Elm Disease</li>
 <li>'Valley Forge' - resistant to Dutch Elm Disease</li>

A small, slow growing, understory tree, native to Ontario and the Niagara region. Also called the Pagoda Dogwood for its horizontal layers of branches with a slight curl at the end. The Alternate-Leaf Dogwood is favourable for birds and attractive in the landscape for its showy flowers, fruit and bark. It can be grown as a clump or with a central leader.
</p>

<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>
Its name, "Alternifolia" depicts it is the only dogwood with an alternate leaf arrangement. Leaf colour is medium-dark green with a nice dark-purple in the fall. Venation is arcuate (like all dogwoods)
</p>

<h3>Flowers & Fruit</h3>
<p>
Flowers in mid to late May for 2 weeks showing true flowers (not showy white bracts). Berries are dark purple with bright red peduncles (stems of fruit). They are a favourite food for birds.

A small, slow growing, understory tree, native to Ontario and the Niagara region. Also called the Pagoda Dogwood for its horizontal layers of branches with a slight curl at the end. The Alternate-Leaf Dogwood is favourable for birds and attractive in the landscape for its showy flowers, fruit and bark. It can be grown as a clump or with a central leader.
</p>

<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>
Its name, "Alternifolia" depicts it is the only dogwood with an alternate leaf arrangement. Leaf colour is medium-dark green with a nice dark-purple in the fall. Venation is arcuate (like all dogwoods)
</p>

<h3>Flowers & Fruit</h3>
<p>
Flowers in mid to late May for 2 weeks showing true flowers (not showy white bracts). Berries are dark purple with bright red peduncles (stems of fruit). They are a favourite food for birds.

    [body] => <p>A North American countryside tree known for its hight and unique overarching habit.
Dutch Elm Disease has driven the American Elm to near extinction, changing Its average lifespan from 400 to under 100 years.</p>

<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Dark green with uninteresting yellow, green or brown fall colour. Short, stiff hairs on the upper surface causes it to have a rough, sand paper-like texture. The leaf base is usually unequal.</p>

<h3>Twigs & Buds</h3>
<p>Buds slant to one side. The bark of trunk has deep ridges and grooves.</p>

<h3>Pests & Disease</h3>
<p>Dutch Elm Disease is a fungus that attacks the tree's vascular system and it has killed almost all American Elms in North America. The Elm Bark Beetle is it's vector, spreading fungus spores from infected trees to healthy ones. An anti-fungal injection can be used every two years as a preventative.</p>
<p>Winnipeg, Manitoba has managed to protect its elms, cold weather kills the beetles, and the province has been adamant at preventing the disease there.</p>
<p>Some American Elms have developed a natural resistance to Dutch Elm Disease. The University of Guelph has taken advantage of these survivors and is creating seedlings Elms resistant to the Disease.</p>

<h3>Popular Cultivars</h3>
<ul>
 <li>'Accolade' - hybrid with the Japanese Elm and resistant to Dutch Elm Disease</li>
 <li>'Valley Forge' - resistant to Dutch Elm Disease</li>

The trunk forms a straight central leader with deep ridges and furrows (diamond pattern) in the bark. It is widely planted in suburbs for its form and nice fall colour. The wood is strong, elastic and fibrous, useful for making hockey sticks, bats, toboggans and other items where strength is needed.</p>

<h3>Leaves</h3>
<p>Compound, pointed leaves with serrated or entire margins. Leaves consist of 7-9 but usually 7 leaflets. Leaves are usually larger than green ash, but smaller than Black Ash. The colour is medium green on the top with the lightest colour underneath compared to Green or Black Ashes. Potentially nice red-purple fall colour.</p>

<h3>Twigs & Buds</h3>
<p>Dark reddish-brown buds within a u-shaped leaf scar (Green Ash buds are on-top of the leaf scar).
White Ash has smooth bark on young, upper branches (black ash has more fissured bark on these areas).</p>

<h3>Seeds</h3>
<p>Large clusters of elongated, oar-shaped samara. In important food for wildlife such as birds and beavers.</p>

<h3>Pests</h3>
<p>Emerald Ash Borer is a major threat to all species of Ash tree species. The initial outbreak started in Detroit Michigan and has progressed to Ontario and Quebec. Currently it is on its way to Nova Scotia. The adult female beetle deposits an egg just underneath the bark where larvae feed on the tree's cambium in a zig-zag pattern.
An injection of neem oil into the tree's vascular system every 2 years can be used as a preventative.</p>
