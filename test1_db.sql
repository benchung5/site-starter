Dough found his place as a coach and educator to children; teaching them about nature and the environment. \r\nThere is a place for everyone at the eco park, Doug explained. You don\'t have to be a plant expert. Where some are nearly fluent in botanical latin, others have beneficial strengths in other areas. Students, Colleges and researchers actively preserve and learn from the land.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt\'s strange, but many of us, even some working at the eco park struggle to identify the variety of native plants that grow in abundance in our local Carolinian forest and grasslands, yet they can add much to the landscape in beauty, pollination, medicine and food.

(131, 'exploring-the-usefulness-of-the-Eastern-red-cedar', 'The Usefulness of the Eastern Red Cedar', '<figure>\r\n <img src=\"/uploads/articles/eastern-red-cedar-145.jpg\">\r\n <figcaption>Juniperus Virginiana (Ontario, Canada)</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Eastern Red Cedar (Juniperus virginiana) is a small, shrubby, rugged-looking tree that grows in north/east America. It can often be seen in farmers’ fields, forest edges, and fenced road sides. Juniperus Virginiana is actually a Juniper and some botanists do not separate J. Virginiana from Silicicola (Caine, S).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt wouldn’t be surprising if you’ve seen many of these timid trees scattered along field edges when driving on the road, yet thought nothing of them. I’ve often wondered about the presence of these mysterious junipers and whether or not they’re native or introduced. Looking into it more closely, I realized they’ve been here in southern Ontario for thousands of years and have much to offer in terms of economic, biological, and artistic value.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>\r\nLumber Material\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nSince the trees rarely reach over 40 feet tall, Eastern Red Cedar Wood, would not normally be suitable for use on large structures. However, Its red color and fragrance make it ideal for the construction of drawer linings and fine furniture. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIts warm tones, alluring scent, and unique shapes and textures lend itself well to rustic furniture designs and attractive features in finer grade lumber. In addition to exterior landscape and decking products, builders are also sourcing for new uses like interior cabinetry and paneling, countertops, and flooring. \r\nEisenberg, KC (2018). \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHistorically, early settlers have made a living selling the tolerant, long-lasting wood for wine barrel creation. ”Following the Civil War, many impoverished landowners along tributaries of the Mississippi River became re-established financially by floating cedar logs into staves and headings to be shipped to French wineries.”(Hemmerly, 1970). Barrels used for aging Gin also often use Juniper wood to create an enhanced long refreshing taste.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nToday, it seems like the market for these trees are growing, as companies find new sustainable techniques to harvest and make use of the lumber. The trend has especially taken off in the west. Jenkins (2004) states; ”The analysis estimated that the U.S. eastern red cedar market generates almost $60 million annually in gross sales and is growing, Gold said. Almost 40 percent of survey respondents indicated that demand for red cedar products had increased in the past 5 years, and about half felt it would continue increasing over the next 5 years.”\r\n</p>\r\n<figure>\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"> <img src=\"/uploads/articles/eastern-red-cedar-logs-144.jpg\"></div>\r\n <figcaption>“Juniper Mills” in Eastern Oregon. Image from snwwood.com</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>\r\nThe unique, wavy colour patterns add character like no other wood. A look at the Sustainable Northwest website http://www.snwwood.com/Blog/Juniper , has pushed its limit, creating beautiful decks, garden beds, and retaining walls from harvested Juniper lumber. I’m excited about finding out what other interesting projects others used it for. The great thing is that it’s easy to find for eastern Canadian/Americans and (depending on where you live) possibly free! \r\n</p>\r\n<h2>\r\nHealth Benefits\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nDifferent parts of the tree have been used in various culinary concoctions long before settlers came. Joe@EatThePlanet (2013) states; “Native Americans often added juniper berries to food dishes and grains like flour for a hint of flavor. Deer and other meat was often cooked with Juniper berries. They were prepared different ways by different tribes but some of the preparation methods include drying, soaking, mashing, or just eating them raw.” It’s nice to know that if you were ever stranded in the woods and needed to hunt game, you could have a way and means of seasoning your meat!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI was surprised to find out about the detoxifying abilities these Junipers have Medicinally. Uses range from common flu treatment to fighting parasites and stomach issues. Joe@EatThePlanet (2013) goes on to say; \"The berries of Eastern Red Cedar have a number of medicinal uses. A Tea made from the berries has been commonly used for the treatment of coughs and colds, and to expel intestinal worms\". There are, however, some Juniper species that have poisonous berries which can be confused with Juniperus Virginiana. So if you plan on using it for ingestion, just make sure that it’s thoroughly identified first!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nCedar/Juniper Oil is also commonly used for health and wellness applications. “The bark of the Red Cedar is used to make many different fragrances, such as essential oils.” (Lakeforest College Environmental Studies). I have a bottle of this oil that has been sitting in my bathroom cabinet for years. The oil never perishes and it reminds me of the smell of Christmas. It also makes a great vapo-rub for sore throat and muscles.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>\r\nBonsai Production \r\n</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nThe initial reason I grew an interest in Juniperus Virginiana was for potential Bonsai material. Fine scaled branches and its general “smallness” was a winning feature for me when passing by it for the first time. \r\n</p>\r\n<figure>\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AzO42Q44w4M\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r\n<figcaption>Eastern Red Cedar bonsai video showcase</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p>\r\nThere are many good examples already on the web using Eastern Red Cedar including the bonsai styles: Cascade, Informal Upright, Literati, Shari and more. Caine, S. states; “With sufficient early training, the red cedar can be used for most styles, though multiple-trunk styles probably require planting multiple trees close together.” Junipers in general are currently one of the most easy trees to train as bonsai. Harrington(2017), mentions Juniper’s popularity in the bonsai world as it lends itself readily to jins and sharis (deadwood effect).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThese Cuttings were taken in early fall (below). I also have a set from Early Summer that have resisted mold and rot in less than ideal conditions. Unfortunately the cuttings didn\'t take as easily as with other junipers. Months later, some survive, but I have yet to see roots.\r\n</p>\r\n<img alt=\"eastern red cedar cuttings\" src=\"/uploads/articles/eastern-red-cedar-cuttings-147.jpg\"/>\r\n<p>\r\nJunipers are normally long-lived which usually makes them suitable and sustainable as bonsai. This tree is not incredibly age tolerant, but decent. According to the article, Juniperus Virginiana (Eastern Red Cedar) Cupressaceae (Lake Forest College); they have a lifespan of - 100 to 300 years. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo next time you take a walk by a forest edge, field, or wetland area, see if you can spot an Eastern Red Cedar. As long as you don’t feel weird about it, feel it’s leaves, smell it’s bark, look at the fruit and most of all see all of its potential! Tell your friends about what you know. There’s value in every tree and Juniperus Virginiana is certainly no exception.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>\r\nReferences \r\n</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nLake Forest College Environmental Studies.

Last year I bought my first shrubs and plants online from an Ontario Native Plant store. Oddly enough I can\'t find their online store anymore, but I\'m sure they\'re still on the web somewhere. They are a family owned business that exclusively ship native trees and plants only. I was impressed by the streamlined checkout process and the quality of product as it arrived in the mail. Many big box stores have also been selling plants online for some time. These include Walmart.com, eBay.com, Jet.com, Esbenshades.com and others. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amazon is a huge contributor and has a 25 percent increase in gardening products yearly. Independent retailers can also act as third-party sellers on the Amazon marketplace. They can handle shipping themselves or ship to Amazon warehouses and let them handle the dirty work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, there are some issues with this new trend. Selling online is more pricey compared to big box sores or garden centres. Shipping plants are subject to state and country regulations. Some avoid Amazon altogether to preserve brand quality and integrity. Also, people are worried about Amazon continually squeezing more fees from retailers as demand grows. The amount of time trees and plants can stay boxed up is also an important factor to consider.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/uploads/articles/sell-plants-online-business-149.jpg\"/>\r\n\r\n<p>There are mixed opinions, but without doubt, the way plants are being sold is evolving and companies can take advantage of the change if they approach it with care. In the coming years, growers will have access to a wider range of clients and clients will have access to trees and shrubs how and when they want them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>References:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hansen, J.

However, there are some major side effects that come along with its overuse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cost in damage alone is enough to raise serious attention. Road salt has caused $3 billion dollars in vehicle depreciation in Quebec and Ontario as well as $5 billion in damage to infrastructure in Canada. The affected areas include trees, plants, roads, bridges, structures and cars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The environment is also greatly affected. Salt applied to our cities and homes runs off with melted ice into rivers, lakes and streams. This harms our freshwater ecosystems and groundwater. It has gotten to the point where some salt water animals are now living in Canada\'s freshwater areas. 10,000 lakes across north America are at risk. Lake Simcoe for example is now 5 times saltier that it was 40 years ago</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a reaction to the problem, cities are attempting to reduce their salt use and try other alternatives. Calgary, parts of BC and Wisconsin are using cheese brine and beet juice as a de-icing method. Ecotraction is another product which doesn\'t melt the ice but sticks to it providing traction. Edmonton is using calcium chloride brine which is less corrosive and safer for the environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest problems is general public opinion. Half of the total salt used yearly is spread by home owners and private businesses. The public has unreasonable expectations and doesn\'t like the idea of some traction-based alternatives not actually melting the ice. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are lots of good alternatives out there, but the best solution may be a change in attitude. Applying salt and forgetting about tomorrow is easy, but long-term over use will greatly affect our economy and precious ecosystems in the end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>References:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith, W. and Kim, R.

It turns out there is a proper way tree roots are meant to grow and interferance with this structure can have a dramatic effect on the growth rate and vigor of trees. \r\n<figure class=\"float-right\">\r\n<img src=\"/uploads/articles/tangled-citrus-roots-164-med.jpg\" alt=\"tangled citrus roots\">\r\n<figcaption>Young citrus tree with poor root structure</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This winter, Jason Henry from Vineland research visited Niagara College to talk about experiments they\'ve been conducting regarding proper tree root formation in the seedling stage. When asked by a client \"what pots would you recommend to use for tree propagation\" they couldn\'t suggest any particular brand. This sparked curiosity which led to research and eventually the creation of their own product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In nature, tree seedlings often send out a tap root. This is a thick root that protrudes downward to anchor the tree in the ground and establish stability quickly. Once they are anchored, the tap root stops growing and the tree begins to progressively send roots out horizontally. Horizontal roots can span very far distances, usually 2-3 times the diameter of the tree\'s crown. Roots spread out radially away from the trunk to gather nutrients and oxygen from the soil just above the surface.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"horizontal root structure\" src=\"/uploads/articles/horizontal-root-structure2-175.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption>In nature, tree roots span far and are shallow in depth</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<figure class=\"float-left\">\r\n<img src=\"/uploads/articles/Depositphotos_50260949_xl-2015-174.jpg\" alt=\"Depositphotos__xl\">\r\n<figcaption>Pot-bound tree</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\nIn nurseries, limited space and convenience often cause growers to use pots to propagate trees. Trees are transplanted to new pots as roots outgrow their soil volume. The problem, however, is when roots reach the edges of these pots. When this happens, over time, the tree will become \"pot-bound\" (roots become restricted to the shape of the pot). \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s difficult to know or plan for when this will happen and transplanting will not correct issues of pot-bound roots after they\'ve already been shaped. Jason explained the different types of pot-bound root problems he encountered throughout his research: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>circling</li>\r\n <li>\"J\"</li>\r\n <li>decending </li>\r\n <li>ascending</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Circling happens when horizontal roots reach pot edges and wind around in circles. This is the most common problem in potted plants. Some pots have angular shapes, creating grooves vertically along the sides of the pot to prevent this circling habit. However, roots can still direct upward or downward, creating \"ascending or \"depending\" roots. \"J\" roots primarily happen when downward growing tap roots turn upwards once unable to penetrate the base of the pot.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img src=\"/uploads/articles/potted-root-problems-172.jpg\" alt=\"potted root problems\">\r\n<figcaption></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Air pruning is one method many companies are using to deal with these types of problems. \r\nWhen roots reach open air, they stop growing, tips die and fine feeder roots branch off. This is a good thing since fine roots are responsible for gathering air and nutrients. As a result, air pruning not only prevents root stems from directing along pot edges, but it encourages the production a dense, fibrous root system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the air pruning pots used during the project at Vineland Research had vertical or horizontal slits on pot edges. Although there was some effectiveness in this approach, Jason explained roots still tended to avoid the air openings and follow the lines of plastic along pot edges horizontally or vertically when available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This led to experimentations with Ellepots. These are sustainable, decomposable paper cylinders filled with growing media. All edges of these pots have enough air exposure to prune any roots coming in contact with them. The problem was finding a tray to hold the Ellepots. Many had bracing structures which still allowed some roots to follow them in the pattern they formed, preventing those roots from being pruned. It was an improvement but not a perfect solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"img-strip\">\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img src=\"/uploads/articles/ellepots-165.jpg\" alt=\"ellepots\">\r\n<figcaption>Ellepots</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img src=\"/uploads/articles/rootsmart-ellipot-167.JPG\" alt=\"rootsmart ellipot\">\r\n<figcaption>Ellepots in Rootsmart trays</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>After much effort, they concluded they needed to construct their own solution to the problem. The Rootsmart system was born. and I was fortunate enough to see their first greenhouse conference showcase in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On display were young, field-grown trees with both good and bad root structure. Trees with good structure were much larger and healthier than ones with poor structure of the same maturity. Benefits of trees started in Rootsmart pots were evident when trees were planted in the field. Even, radial, feeder, and horizontal root growth enable young trees to gather more air and nutrients. </p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img src=\"/uploads/articles/rootsmart-roots1-168.JPG\" alt=\"rootsmart roots\">\r\n<figcaption>Field tree with proper root formation</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>On the opposite end, trees with poor, pot-bound roots formed in pots during propagation stages were not able to correct themselves once planted in the field. They were stuck with the tangled mess they were started with.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img src=\"/uploads/articles/tangled-roots-170.JPG\" alt=\"tangled roots\">\r\n<figcaption>Field tree with tangled roots</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies have shown early root growth will determine root structure on full sized trees. Due to proper root establishment in early stages of life, Rootsmart trees will be larger, healthier and more stable when grown to their full maturity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What does the Rootsmart system look like? Propagation trays are 14.72” by 14.72” in length and width. Each tray is be filled with Ellepots. The Ellepots are only suspended at the very top and minimally at the bottom, preventing plastic surface area for roots to follow. All trays are high quality and stackable, allowing for easy shipping and good usage of space.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img src=\"/uploads/articles/RootSmart-tray-photo-from-AMA-169.jpg\" alt=\"RootSmart tray photo from AMA\">\r\n<figcaption>Rootsmart trays</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>What about when seedlings need to be transplanted to larger pots?

The fungus is native to Cyberia and has been present in the west since the turn of the century; likely introduced from Ribes spp. brought in as ornamentals from Europe. The disease spreads from cool and moist conditions usually in late summer and rapidly spreads over long distances. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>White pine blister rust generally needs a five needle pine like eastern white pine and a currant or gooseberry to complete its lifecycles. Since 2006, however, research has discovered there are at least a couple of species besides Ribes that Can be an alternate host for the rust. This includes indian paint brush (Castillija spp.), snapdragon (Pedicularis spp.), and possibly others. The disease had made a considerable economic impact on the white pine lumber industry and both ecological and aesthetic impacts on white bark pine, sugar pine, bristlecone pine, eastern white pine, and western white pine.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\r\n\r\n<h3>Diagnosis</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>Kills Branches, tree tops, and whole trees of five needle pine</li>\r\n <li>Causes leaf loss and leaf spots of currant and gooseberry</li>\r\n <li>Needles turn yellow then rusted red with many tiny dots</li>\r\n <li>Swollen discoloured or cracked areas on trunk or branches (canker)</li>\r\n <li>Sticky clear to white resin oozing from cankers</li>\r\n <li>chewing from rodents on resinous areas (due to sweetness of the sap)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>How it works</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Spores from the Ribes shrubs are carried on cool, moist air currants in late summer to early fall. They land on pine needles, entering them through the stomata or wounds. In the spring, they become infected, turn brown and may fall off. Within a few years the fungus moves to branches creating cankered areas. It then progresses towards the main trunk at a rate of about 3 inches per year. If the fungus girdles the main trunk it can kill entire young trees. Only tree tops and branches are killed on older trees. \r\nThe fist summer after infection, gummy orange spores may be present on the cankers. The following spring, white blisters at the edges of cankers form, crack open to release spores (powdery yellowish orange). These then infect Ribes spp. Shrubs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After infection it creates a new type of spore on the underside of Ribes leaves (urediniospores), these produce new leaf spots on the crown and other nearby Ribes shrubs. When the season cools, white hairs are produced on the spores (cilia). These produce another type of spore called basidiospores which are dispersed by cool moist air currants to again infect white pine trees.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Care</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>Prune diseased branches before 4 inches of the main trunk</li>\r\n <li>Select disease resistant gooseberries or currants</li>\r\n <li>Select disease resistant white pine trees</li>\r\n <li>Plant to provide adequate space for air circulation</li>\r\n <li>Prune lower branches slowly as trees mature</li>\r\n <li>Avoid overhead irrigation</li>\r\n <li>Avoid planting in low, cool areas</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"small-text\">\r\n<h3>References </h3>\r\n\r\n<p>High Elevation White Pines.

It\'s a\r\ncombination of the small beech scale insect (0.5 to 1mm long) and canker fungus (Nectria canker); targeting American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and European beech (F. sylvatica). The nectria fungus is likely native but beech scale is not. The insect is native to Europe, introduced to Nova Scotia in 1890. It continues to expand across eastern North America and is now in southern Ontario.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"beech bark disease symptoms\" src=\"/uploads/articles/original-182.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption>© jaq_weber, some rights reserved (CC-BY-NC)</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>How it works</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Female scale insects deposit their eggs in bark fissures mid-summer. Scale nymphs hatch, mature, and feed on the sap, colonizing and forming a wooly wax covering overtop of them. They bore openings in the bark for the fungus to enter and infect the tree. This disease invades the bark, cambium and sapwood of the tree causing blisters, calluses, cankers, sometimes oozing sap. There\'s a 50 to 85% mortality rate within 10 years from initial scale/fungus infestation, resulting in either direct death or weakness and death by other pathogens. Dead mature trees sucker at the roots, disrupting other saplings like maple and birch, altering the ecosystem. These saplings will likely only grow to eventually become infected again.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Symptoms</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>Significant dieback or death if mature trees</li>\r\n <li>Severe cankering and deformation on stems</li>\r\n <li>Small yellow leaves</li>\r\n <li>Wilting foliage</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"small-text\">\r\n<p>Invasive Species Centre.

It\'s caused by several closely related fungus where each is specific to the type of tree is infects. Anthracnose mainly affects new growth including leaves, buds, and sometimes stems. It\'s not known to completely kill tress as most trees can leaf out again in the same season. Some trees are more susceptible to the disease than others. While Oak, dogwood, ash, and sycamore can have severe cases of anthracnose; hickory, linden, willow, birch, maple, and walnut can also less severely.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"anthracnose on sycamore\" src=\"/uploads/articles/anthracnose-on-sycamore-189.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<figcaption>© Susan J. Hewitt, some rights reserved (CC-BY-NC)</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<h3>Symptoms</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Anthracnose usually more frequent and severe on lower branches where humidity is highest. Brown to black blotches, spots, or irregular shapes usually appear on and around leaf veins. Its appearance can closely resemble sun scorch. The damage occurs at or near the growing tips, and leaves can become distorted as a result of abnormal growth expansion. Young leaves may die and fall off. Cankers on stems are a possibility on some cases such as sycamore. Over the years, disfigured branch growth can happen since the disease causes branch tips to die, allowing side shoots to dominate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How it works</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The fungus resides in infected leaves and branches, either fallen or present on the tree. In the spring, the fungus is activated during persistent cool wet conditions, releasing spores carried by rain or air currents to leaves and branches. New spores are then created, infecting more foliage and spreading again throughout the growing season. Often trees attacked in spring are able to survive and re-leaf in the summer.</p>\r\n\r\nPrevention and treatment\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>Use good sanitation practices</li>\r\n <li>clean up fallen leaves and debris</li>\r\n <li>Prune away infected, dead, and dying branches</li>\r\n <li>Promote good air circulation and avoid overhead irrigation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Spraying with fungicides may only be effective if caught early and full coverage is applied. Good cultural practice such as sanitation, watering and mulching when needed is the most recommended choice for prevention and treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"small-text\">\r\n<p>Iowa State University Extension and Outreach.

What kind? That\'s beyond me. There are about 30 species native to Canada and many are hybrids or hard to tell apart.

Depending on the species of tree, surface roots can be an abnormality, structural concern, and can have a negative affect on aesthetics. When surface roots are exposed to foot traffic and lawn machines the result is often damage and a chance for decay or pathogens to enter the tree from the ground up.</p>\r\n<img alt=\"Surface roots\" src=\"/uploads/articles/20200106_145358-220.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<p>Soil compaction is a major cause. Trees respire (breathe) through their roots and without air pockets, roots may rise to the surface to force access to oxygen. Compaction can be caused by construction or failure to provide adequate topsoil when planting. Ball and burlap planting can be a source cause of surface root formation. Failing to remove the wire and burlap trees are often shipped in can cause roots to take the path of least resistance and force themselves out through the surface.</p>\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"Surface roots\" src=\"/uploads/articles/20200106_141006-219.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>We\'ve heard of planting trees too deeply, it\'s a common practice, but what about planting trees too shallow? Once past the seedling stage, roots may seldom be able to change their initial direction of growth.

In urban settings it can be caused by construction or the or removal of surface soil by other means.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you notice many surface roots and are worried about the health of your tree.

Its effects have been mild to detrimental in all industry including agriculture. A casual Saturday trip the grocery store has turned into what can seem like a visit to a maximum-security prison. Both positive and negative changes are now happening in agriculture as a result of the current situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/articles/dan-meyers-IQVFVH0ajag-unsplash-223.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption><span>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@dmey503?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Dan Meyers</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/canadian-agriculture?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></span></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>A farmer colleague of a relative of mine has expressing serious financial difficulties recently, due to COVID-19 regulations. Farmer must now physically separate foreign workers much more than previously practiced upon entering the working field. The cost of employee room and board has become unfeasible to some farms due to the fact that they cannot all share the same living quarters as they previously did. \"Temporary foreign workers must be healthy upon arrival and practice self-isolation measures. There are serious implications for farms that don\'t follow these guidelines which include hiring foreign labour in the future.\" (Manning; 2020)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is also inconsistency in what farmers can produce and how they produce it. Due to school closures and the loss of jobs in other industries, certain products have suddenly halted in demand and others have increased. Farmers can\'t work from home virtually and can\'t practice production-on-demand after seeds are already planted. Agriculture simply cannot turn on a dime when market change occurs at the rate it has been lately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Labour shortages are also a major issue in the States due to disallowance of foreign workers. Though not an issue for Canadian farms, our food supply is highly dependent on the U.S. According to experts, there will be options on the shelves, but not the bounty and selection we\'re normally used to.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/articles/matthias-mitterlehner-KRmHft73IBE-unsplash-224.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption><span>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@mattmitt?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Matthias Mitterlehner</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/foreign-workers-agriculture?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></span></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Bright Side</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The good news is these restrictions have caused a general market demand within the food industry. People are stalking up on food storage, and supermarkets are one of the few stores still considered essential. Agriculture is \"crucial to our food security and our rural economies.\" (Manning; 2020) Community gardens, farmers markets and CSA (community supported agriculture) are also still allowed to be open. They simply must consider limiting the allowed number of personal on site, include extensive use of disinfectants, and cancel large gatherings and events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Essential, seasonal foreign workers will be able to continue helping on farms. The government is doing everything it can to support farmers during these uncertain times. \"On March 20, the federal government announced its travel restrictions would not apply to essential businesses such as food transportation, nor to seasonal agricultural workers, which eased fears among Canadian farmers who rely on migrant workers\" (Fraiman; 2020). The government has waived the Labour Market Impact Assessment (an assessment to hire foreign labour) for 6 months, and the maximum employment duration has been increased from one year to two. Lastly, financially support and ease of debts/loans have been extended to Canadian farmers. This includes $3 billion on cash advances, and flexible financing plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though the virus is highly contagious, it appears to be food-safe. We as consumers should be happy to find out that food its-self is considered a \"safe\" product and it should not be a topic of worry regarding Corona Virus contraction. \"COVID-19 is not a foodborne illness. It is extremely unlikely that someone will catch it through eating.\" (NC State Extension; 2020)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The way food makes its way to customers has also drastically changed over the past few months. Many farms are moving towards online sales, especially in China where self-isolation has been extensive. Also, as a result of reduced business, courier companies are finding ways to deliver food to homeowners instead of bringing homeowners to food. </p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"seedlings\" src=\"/uploads/articles/markus-spiske-4PG6wLlVag4-unsplash-225.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption><span>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@markusspiske?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Markus Spiske</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/seed-banks?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></span></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people who are out of work and practicing isolation have acquired an interest in growing their own food. As a result, seed banks and online garden centres have witnessed an influx in sales. William Dams\'s (where I normally purchase my vegetable seeds) expressed delays and backups due to overwhelming orders they’ve received recently. Growing food at home has allowed the public to decide on their own quality control and sanitation, and there is no need for wait times or worry of contracting the virus from others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How the pandemic will unfold in coming months is uncertain. It may be some time until industry, life, and the economy return back to its normal state. However, farms as we know them have been faced with situations never yet encountered. As of the onset of COVID-19, positive and negative change will undoubtedly impact the history agriculture forever.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"small-text\">\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Fraiman, M.

Larch are known for their short needles which grow in tufts like a pine, but along their stems like a fir tree. Though less popular as a landscape plant, they can be a nice addition to naturalized landscapes and be grown from seed given patience and the right conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"larch cones\" src=\"/uploads/articles/original-1-229.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<figcaption>© Sean Grasing, some rights reserved (CC-BY-NC)</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>To collect tamarack seeds from the wild, first find a specimen. They\'re usually found in boggy forest openings from central to Eastern Canada. Find a mature tree with cones. Their seed crops occur 2-6 years apart on trees at least 8 years old, so not all trees will bear seeds. Cones should be collected on the tree in the fall before they open and dry. To encourage them to open, leave them in a warm, dry area and they should eventually open on their own. Good seeds are brown and are the earliest to disperse. Tan color is less desirable and old cones don\'t contain viable seeds so always pick fresh cones directly off the tree as early as they start to produce. Find viable seeds by placing them in water and seeing which ones float. Soak then store seeds in and envelope and refrigerate. Tamarack seeds can last for several years.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"tamarack\" src=\"/uploads/articles/large-227.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption>© Mike Jones, some rights reserved (CC-BY-NC)</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>The seeds will need to be exposed to the cold for a period of time to mimic a full winter and the return of spring. This is called stratification. To do this, store them for about two months at around 4 degrees C (40 degrees F) or plant them outdoors in the fall. Stratify in moist sand, soil, or sphagnum peat moss.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"planting\" src=\"/uploads/articles/neslihan-gunaydin-BduDcrySLKM-unsplash-231.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption><span>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@neslihangunaydin?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Neslihan Gunaydin</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/pot-and-soil?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></span></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Plant the stratified seed outside in a pot or open ground with adequate space. Tamarack thrives in moist, boggy, sunny conditions with cool summers and cold winters in the wild. Consequently, a location with moist to wet and acidic soil with of PH of 5.0 - 6.0 is needed for it to grow well. The tree is intolerant of dry, shallow, chalky or polluted soils and planting location should have full light exposure. It takes about 40 days to germinate and will need a warm temperature (from 18° to 21° C or 65° to 70° F) to start growing. Larch are very susceptible to damping off until 4-5 weeks old. Damping off is the weakening of stems and roots during a plant\'s seedling stage due to fungal disease. Proper warmth, drainage, sunlight, air circulation, and sterile soil are some ways to avoid the condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ideally, fertilize the tree during its young stages for a minimum of 2 years. Tamarack has a medium to fast growth rate (2.5 feet per year) in its youth. This slows down over time. Healthy trees can reach from 70 to 75 feet high and 25 to 30 feet wide at maturity.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"tamarack\" src=\"/uploads/articles/large-1-230.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption>© Lewnanny Richardson, some rights reserved (CC-BY-NC)</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"small-text\">\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>O\'Connor J. 2012.

Native to Europe, it was introduced into North America in the late 1800\'s. The adults are small gray moths. Moth larvae bore into needles in late summer causing browning and heavy defoliation. Tiny, brown, cigar-shaped pupae cases can be seen near twig buds after needles shed in winter. Dry, brown needles on large portions of the canopy are a sign of the case-bearer. Control could involve spraying with insecticides in early May or using Agathis pumila and Chrysocharis laricinellae parasites for biocontrol.</p>\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"larch case bearer\" src=\"/uploads/articles/case-bearer-232.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:37.066_BF526_Larch_Case-bearer,_Coleophora_laricella_(16934623635).jpg\">Patrick Clement from West Midlands, England</a>, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0\">CC BY 2.0</a>, via Wikimedia Commons</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<h3>Larch Sawfly</h3>\r\n<p>A combination of damage caused by the egg laying of small wasp-like insects and the feeding of their caterpillar-like larvae. \r\nEgg laying from the adult sawfly cause young shoots to dry out and curl, which stops them from growing. This reduces the number of buds and eventually results in crown deformation. The larvae can cause mass defoliation within the canopy.

Although these advances have allowed us to grow larger, prettier and more fruitful plants than ever before, our decision has left us with larger problems. Polluted waterways, poisoned wildlife and depleted soils are on the rise, and the situation has left our planet in a state of serious concern. (\"How Fertilizers Harm Earth More Than Help Your Lawn\", n.d.)</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"fertilizer\" src=\"/uploads/articles/sigmund-3WJIBxjWVYI-unsplash-248.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption><span>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@sigmund?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Sigmund</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/large-flowers?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></span></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of global ecological crisis, Yale E360, 2019 defines planetary boundaries as a \"safe operating space for humanity\". We are at the point where necessary changes need to be made, or our planet may not be able to recover. The article goes on about planetary boundaries, mentioning: \"Of the nine considered, just biodiversity loss and nitrogen pollution are estimated to have been crossed, unlike CO2 levels, freshwater used and ozone losses.\" This means that nitrogen pollution levels (primarily caused by fertilizers) have already exceeded levels of toleration to a point where it is already affecting our planetary safety and wellbeing.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"atmosphere\" src=\"/uploads/articles/miguel-a-amutio-bQgat1I0hVs-unsplash-245.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption><span>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@amutiomi?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Miguel A. Amutio</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/atmosphere-harm?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></span></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most prominent effects of nitrogen pollution is the loss of aquatic species and biodiversity. This is a result of damaged water systems due to runoff from over fertilization. Naturally occurring eutrophication (release of nutrients into bodies of water) happens over thousands of years as rain leeches soil and organic matter into lakes and rivers. When fertilizers are used in abundance and enter our waterways eutrophication is multiplied and fertilizer becomes a pollutant. The building of residential areas and deforestation has also caused topsoils to run into lakes even more quickly which is multiplying the already harmful effects of fertilizers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How does this work? The excess nutrients cause algae to rapidly increase in abundance turning water from clear to soupy. Green algae quickly takes over the heated surface waters. When dead, they sink to the bottom and decompose. The buildup of sediments cause anaerobic bacteria to take over, removing oxygen from the hypolimnion (cold bottom waters). Aquatic species die under these conditions as oxygen levels are as low as zero. Due to temperature differences, the upper and lower waters don’t mix. Only carp and catfish survive the thick green top layer but will eventually be lost as well. The detrimental effects of deoxygenation cause vast \'dead zones\' and sometimes impassable waterways for fish, plants and amphibians. (Bush, Mark B. 2003; see also “How Fertilizers Harm Earth More Than Help Your Lawn\", n.d)</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"waterways\" src=\"/uploads/articles/DSC_8768-241.JPG\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Though cities are contributing much to leeching; farming practices are likely the most dominant cause. U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) researcher Rick Haney states: “Our mindset nowadays is that if you don’t put down fertilizer, nothing grows. But that’s just not true, and it never has been. The biggest issue with all this is that we keep wanting to get higher and higher yields. But the reality is that you are shooting yourself in the foot doing that\" (Schiffman, 2017)</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"soil\" src=\"/uploads/articles/soil-239.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<p>Chemical fertilizers affect the biology of our soils. This not only increases our reliance on these petroleum products but causes a disturbance to beneficial micro-organisms that cycle nutrients in the soil naturally. 1 gram of healthy soil contains 6-100 million micro-organisms. These microbes break down organic matter to provide texture, nutrients, minerals and other essential ingredients to plant life. Microbes feed off of carbon in soil and plant roots will even put out carbon compounds (exudates) to attract them. </p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"roots\" src=\"/uploads/articles/roots-240.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<p>Trees and plants extract carbon from the air and store it in the soil. This is one of the ways carbon is removed from the atmosphere and the proper balance of soil life and health is maintained. When microbes use up the extra nitrogen, they aggressively remove soil carbon, releasing excess Co2 into the air rather than keeping it held within the ground. \r\nSchiffman (2017) states: \"there is evidence that excessive nitrogen actually causes more carbon to leave the system. Whereas we need more carbon in the soil rather than less. \" A decrease in the reliance of organic matter along with excess nitrogen from fertilizer means less carbon in the soil. Less carbon means lower populations of micro-organisms.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"depleted soil\" src=\"/uploads/articles/wolfgang-hasselmann-jXiX3ZzdCVI-unsplash-247.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption><span>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@wolfgang_hasselmann?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Wolfgang Hasselmann</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/depleted-soil?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></span></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>By overuse of chemical fertilizers, we are essentially creating a ‘dead’ soil. This leads to other problems including the overuse of unnecessary pesticides because the soil no longer has a natural supressiveness. \"Since in many cases, antagonistic micro-organisms play a role in soil suppressiveness, the soil has been seen as a reservoir of potential biological control agents. Eilenberg, J., & Hokkanen H.M.T. 2006 states: \"We rely on soil biology to control pathogens that may otherwise grow to harmful levels. This may be fit for an article of its own but is just another example of the many soil depletion side effects. (Eilenberg, J., & Hokkanen H.M.T. 2006; see also \"How Fertilizers Harm Earth More Than Help Your Lawn\", n.d.; Schiffman, 2017)</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"fertilizer\" src=\"/uploads/articles/mycelium-238.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption>micro-organisms (fungi mycelium) </figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>The effects on soil can also be reversed if care is taken: \"The good news is that soil will come back if you give it a chance. It is very robust and resilient. It’s not like we have destroyed it to the point where it can’t be fixed. The soil health movement is trying to bring those organic levels back up and get soil to a higher functioning state.\" (Schiffman, 2017)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One way to accelerate soil recovery and preservation is through the use of cover crops. Cover crops are a simple, age old practice that could have huge implications on synthetic fertilizer reduction and overall planetary health.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"cover crops\" src=\"/uploads/articles/markus-spiske-B8z6hl9VdcE-unsplash-244.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<figcaption><span>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@markusspiske?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Markus Spiske</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/cover-crops?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></span></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned earlier, open fields that have excess nitrogen between plantings cause microbes to release Co2. By planting cover crops we could pull huge amounts of carbon back into the soil. (Schiffman, 2017). Other benefits include replenishing nitrogen naturally by use of Rhizobium bacteria in legumes. Beans and alfalfa fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, creating their own fertilizer. Legumes and similar cover crops can be used, then processed back into the soil just before the growing season. This provides nitrogen, organic matter, texture and structure all at the same time. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This idea is similar in crop rotation, which involves the planting of a succession of crops with different nutrient demands and replenishing characteristics. One example would be in the order of: wheat, millet, beans, then alfalfa. The first crop (wheat) has high needs for nitrate, millet has lower needs, beans and alfalfa fix nitrogen and can restore it to the soil. By doing so, soil nutrient levels will increase along with better control of insect, weed, and disease cycles. Other benefits include erosion protection and reduced production risk by harvesting different crops. (Bush, Mark B. 2003; see also Fisher, M. R.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Intercropping mimics how things are done in nature and has similar benefits to crop rotation. Fisher, M. R. defines intercropping as a means of \"growing two or more crops in close proximity to each other during part or all of their life cycles to promote soil improvement, biodiversity, and pest management\"(p. 261). Intercropping creates more resilient interspecific relationships. Nutrient cycles become more efficient, as the biodiversity of birds, plants, arthropods, and micro-organisms are increased. (Fisher, M. R.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One could not possibly overlook the need for organics when on the subject of soil sustainability. Soil sustainability means reducing the demand for inorganic compounds and increase reliance on organic pesticides, compost, manure and plant extracts. The use of organics has proven results with a much lower negative environmental impact. \"Good farming centres around taking care of the soil. The soil must have a good structure, be safe from erosion, and have a lively set of decomposers and adequate nutrients. Whereas intensive farms rely on heavy inputs of inorganic fertilizers to maintain fertility, other paths can be followed with equal success\" (Bush, Mark B., 2003, p.371)</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"compost\" src=\"/uploads/articles/joshua-hoehne-Z7W72btGla0-unsplash-1-242.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption><span>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@mrthetrain?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Joshua Hoehne</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/compost?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></span></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Soils with good concentrations of organic matter give plants access nutrients in a unique manner. Microbes have the ability to hold onto nitrogen for a longer period of time; sequestering it in their bodies. Plants access nutrition on an as-needed basis rather than a single forced injection, with limited uptake and plenty of waste from leeching. Other benefits of organics include improved soil structure and better erosion protection. (Ford, D. 2001)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Farmers and the public are beginning to realize methods such compost tea, rock dust and biochar have important economic and environmental benefits. \"It’s clear that compost used as mulch has documented abilities to suppress soil-borne disease organisms.\" (Chalker-Scott, L. PhD. The Myth of Compost Tea Revisited: \"Aerobically-brewed compost tea suppresses disease\")</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some popular organic fertilizers include bone meal, blood meal, feathers, fish emulsion, burned eggshells, and urea (urine) (Penhallegon, 2015). All methods must be used differently and with care. Organic growing takes time and knowledge, but when implemented properly, the benefits are not only ecological, but economical at the same time. Governments and institutions are realizing these benefits and looking for practical, long term solutions that can be readily adopted by growers.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img src=\"/uploads/articles/cdc-T9SwaYf6g40-unsplash-249.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption><span>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@cdc?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">CDC</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/organic-fertilizer?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></span></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>One of these strives is currently under development at Lancaster University. They’ve teamed up with Stopford Energy and Environment Limited, the James Hutton Institute and Aqua Enviro Limited on a sustainable approach to our fertilizer crisis. They propose a mixture of digestates, from anaerobic digestion, and ash from burnt biomass to create an environmentally friendly and sustainable biological fertilizer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digestate-ash is currently being transported to landfills at a cost to the public sector. Its use would not only cut down on government spending but would provide an effective and free active ingredient for their proposed organic fertilizer. Another benefit is that digestate-ash is not linked to oil prices, whereas chemical fertilizers are. Ideally, Digestate-ash would provide a renewable source of organic energy at a reduced cost to farmers. (Lancaster University. 2014)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though far from perfect, changes have been made in terms of government involvement in hope of reversing issues caused by synthetic fertilizers. Research has shown that the damages can be amended over time. \"The truly encouraging aspect that emerges from this data set is that pollution leading to eutrophication is reversible, and nature takes care of the cleanup once the pollution is stopped\" (Bush, Mark B. 2003, p. 358). </p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"fertilizer\" src=\"/uploads/articles/nitrogen-fertilizer-237.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<p>More independent research will increase awareness of our current approach to chemical plant nutrition and its side effects. U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) researcher Rick Haney states: “We are only at the tip of the iceberg in terms of what we understand about how soil functions and its biology.” (Schiffman, 2017). Chemicals may work this year but will end up costing us environmentally and economically in the long run. We need to work with nature instead of against it. The key is not spending more but increasing awareness and changing how things are done. With proper legislation and public participation, we will be more aware of how our plantations are being fed. We will also be in a more promising position to reverse the effects of nitrogen pollution on our planet as a whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"small-text\">\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Bush, Mark B.

(149, 'problems-with-topping-trees-and-better-alternatives', 'Problems With Topping Trees and Better Alternatives', '<p>Topping involves large cuts from the crown of the tree to reduce its height and spread. This is seen all to often on hasty projects despite the negative side effects the come along with this improper practice. Some trees are more negatively affected than others, and they may not die as a result, but all are affected in one form or another. Removing large sections of the crown drastically reduces a tree\'s ability to produce sugars and starches through photosynthesis. This can lead to decline, disease and death within a few years.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"topped trees\" src=\"/uploads/articles/Depositphotos_69147161_xl-2015-250.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<p>Exposed large branch stubs result in major decay as water, fungi, and potential insect pests travel directly down main stems from the open wounds. Topping doesn\'t allow the tree to compartmentalize (isolate) the wound as it normally would if the cut was smaller and near the junction point of another major branch union.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Topping trees puts them in a \'shocked\' state, encouraging them to send out latent/dormant sprouts, also known as adventitious sprouts, epicormic shoots, or water sprouts. They do this in an attempt to restore foliage to continue photosynthesis. These new shoots aren\'t nearly as structurally sound as regular branches. They suffer from weak attachments, posing a threat of breakage from heavy snow loads or high winds. If epicormic shoots are allowed to grow into large stems unpruned, they could post a structural hazard.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Restoring Topped Trees</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Though most topped trees will never return to optimum health and stability, some measures can be taken to bring them back. First, allow the tree to grow untouched for a few years. This will allow the tree to regain valuable energy and resources to stay alive. Then, in late summer, remove any decayed wood, select a new leader from the sprouts, remove one third of them, and shorted the others. Continue to prune yearly, removing branches from crowded areas to allow for dominance and lateral branch development from the new main branch. Try to prevent the branch from becoming a substantial tree stem as its integrity won\'t compare to the other natural main branches.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>An Even Better Approach</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The best approach to alleviating the topping problem is to avoid doing it in the first place. Training trees when they\'re young “…provides the greatest benefit of any cultural practice in influencing the future structure, appearance, and maintenance costs.” (Harris, Clark, Matheny, 1999; p 422.). Pruning at a young age onward eliminates the need for topping and also increases the structural integrity of trees as they grow. Heading cuts involve cutting the tips of branches to a desired length without the need for another branch to redirect its growth. This technique can be used on young trees to maintain their size as they have a more vigorous growth habit, smaller limbs, and are more likely to compartmentalize wounds. With planned pruning from a young age, trees can be kept to a desired size, keeping their graceful habit and health in check. </p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"pollarding\" src=\"/uploads/articles/1032px-Dülmen_Umland_--_2014_--_7064-251.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption>By <a href=\"//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:XRay\" title=\"User:XRay\">Dietmar Rabich</a>, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0\" title=\"Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0\">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>, <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=32016690\">Link</a></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Pollarding is another alternative to topping, but takes planning as with pruning young trees. This technique can often be mistaken as topping, but the approach is very different. Pollarding has been practiced in Europe and some parts of Asia for at least 1,500 years.\r\nOriginally, yearly growth of tree branches were harvested for leather, tanning, livestock, weaving materials, etc. Today, the practice is usually used for design aesthetics and to allow certain trees to grow nicely in tight spaces. Pollarding involves selecting a planned swelling area that latent/dormant buds will develop. Branches are prevented from growing past these points by pruning the shoots off on a yearly basis. Pollarding helps trees stay compact, and can provide interesting specimens for the landscape. Trees trained in this manner are encouraged to develop a callus rather than gaping wounds where adventitious shoots develop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The absolute best approach to avoid topping is to simply select the right size tree for the right area. This may not always be feasible, but hopefully this article provides some alternatives for those who are able to plan ahead or mitigate already topped trees.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"small-text\">\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Harris, R.

(150, 'it-could-be-gypsy-moth', 'Fluffy tufts On Your Tree Bark? It Could Be Gypsy Moth', '<p>Do you see fluffy tufts that look like these sticking to the bark of your tree? Chances are, they\'re egg mounds. Gypsy moth is native to Europe and was introduced to North America in about 1869 near Boston in an attempt to breed with silk worms. After escaping cultivation, their populations moved throughout eastern, central, and some western parts of the United States. It\'s also now well established in Toronto, Niagara, and other parts of south eastern Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"gypsy moth\" src=\"/uploads/articles/20210208_142239-252.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<figcaption>Gypsy moth egg sacks </figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Gypsy moth can completely defoliate trees, especially hardwood species. Oaks are most affected, while silver maple, Norway maple, black cherry, crab apple, poplar, birch, and willow are also affected but usually with less damage. Most trees can tolerate defoliation, but not repeatedly, and when struck by drought or disease this can lead to mortality. Some species are more sensitive to defoliation than others. For example, one season of spruce defoliation can cause to death of the entire tree. Trees kept healthy are more likely to withstand these stresses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gypsy moth populations fluctuate; rise every few years then decline due to natural predators. Male moths are smaller, darker beige in colour, and can fly as opposed to the females. Eggs are laid in late Summer, and remain until early spring. They overwinter in masses usually sticking to the surface and crevices of tree bark. There are about 300 to 1000 eggs per mass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily there are some naturally occurring measures to control gypsy moth populations. Parasitic wasps and flies destroy about 30% of eggs before they hatch. A Fungus introduced from Japan (entomophaga maimaiga) and the virus (Nuclear Polyhedrosis) infect and liquify the caterpillars. Cold weather also controls populations, however, consistently freezing temperatures need to be maintained for a couple of weeks in order to prevent seeds from hatching.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Caterpillars emerge in mid-May and are usually noticed into July. The initial small caterpillar stage is most vulnerable to pesticides. They must be caught early as there is no control option at the mature caterpillar stage or adult moth stage. Caterpillars feed for up to 7 weeks and can grow up to a few inches in length. Droppings (frass) drop from the tree in large amounts as they feed. As voracious eaters, 1 caterpillar can consume a square meter of leaves in its lifetime. Caterpillars pupate (coccoon) from late July to August and emerge as moths a few weeks later.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"gypsy moth larvae\" src=\"/uploads/articles/large-253.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<figcaption>© Nathan Yankech, all rights reserved</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<h3>controlling gypsy moth</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Home owners can take preventative and reactive measures to control gypsy moth infestations in their trees. An effective preventative measure is to first eliminate the eggs. Scrape off egg sacks/mounds and destroy them (make sure they don\'t fall to the ground). Burlap wrapping can be used in mid to late summer to control caterpillar populations. Wrap layered burlap around the trunk and allow caterpillars to enter within the layers to find shelter. Scrape the hiding caterpillars into a pale of soapy water to kill them.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"gypsy moth egg sacks\" src=\"/uploads/articles/20210208_142320-255.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>For large populations, professionals use organic BTK spray which contain the active ingredient Bacillus thuringiensis, a natural soil borne bacteria to destroy the larva digestive system of anything in the moth and butterfly family (lepidopterans ). This must be done in one application at early stages when eggs begin to hatch. Caterpillars must eat the foliage covered in the pesticide in order for it to be effective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other options are injections into the trunk using a neem-based product called TreeAzin. Repeated injections could damage the tree\'s health so only a one time injection is applied. A mating disruptor can also be used after moths pupate. A waxy droplet containing female moth pheromone is sprayed in the surrounding region of infested trees. Its scent floods the area, confusing the males, preventing them from finding females. Since males are at the end of their lifecycle, they often die without mating. These are only effective to prevent moths from mating and keeping them from spreading beyond their current range. Traps can also be placed to determine where populations are heading. They contain pheromone a strip to attract the females, working in a similar way as the mating disruptor.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"gypsy moth\" src=\"/uploads/articles/large-254.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption>© yvesbas, some rights reserved (CC-BY-NC)</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Gypsy moth populations continue to spread westward, and northward as climate change allows for milder weather. Since it is a non-native species, natural predators can only do so much to control gypsy moth outbreaks. Both cities and home owners need to work together to stop the spread of gypsy moth and protect both our forests and urban trees.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"small-text\">\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>City Of Hamilton.

(151, 'winter-protection-for-woody-plants', 'Winter Protection for Woody Plants', '<p>Depending where you live, winter protection for woody plant roots, trunks and canopies may be necessary in your landscape. Selecting cold hardy native plants adapted to your conditions and ensuring they\'re healthy during the growing season is the best measure agains winter damage. This involves proper watering, nutrition, and pruning which strengthens and prepares them for the long winter months. </p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"winter protection for garden plants\" src=\"/uploads/articles/galina-n-AgWVcQz1bOA-unsplash-256.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption><span>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@galina88?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Galina N</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/winter-garden?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></span></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>There are, however, situations where more protection is needed, and there are a few other simple things you can do to prepare. This could involve setting up braces and barriers to protect shrub canopies, using mulch or straw to protect roots, and applying cylinders or wraps to cover trunks. Many insects and pathogens overwinter in fallen leaves and fruit. If this is a concern, dispose of the fallen debris before preparing for winter. Whatever the situation is, plants need to brace themselves for winter on their own at first (harden off). So a good time to start setting up would be after leaves have fallen and the cold weather sets in.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Protecting Leaves and Buds</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Evergreens like yew, hemlock and arborvitae can be susceptible to wind burn, and sun scald on their leaves. Dry air and wind can cause desiccation (drying out) since their frozen roots may not be able to replace water loss from their canopies. Temperature fluctuations can also cause sun scald. Occasional warm temperatures and direct sun can deceivingly stimulate tender cell growth. When the temperature drops again, the tissues die, causing sun scald. One remedy for wind and burn is to plant evergreens in north and north-east facing areas away from the sun, and protecting them from strong winds. A covering such as Burlap/erosion control fabric or anything that gives coverage and air circulation can be used. Though common, studies have shown anti-desiccant to not be effective for evergreen foliage. </p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"winter protection for garden plants\" src=\"/uploads/articles/laura-adai-m9qo5k2xMs8-unsplash-257.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption><span>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@lauraadaiphoto?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">laura adai</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/winter-garden?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></span></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Flowering or fruiting trees and shrubs may experience winter dieback of their buds. This usually happens on delicate flower buds rather than those of leaves or stems. Avoid pruning and fertilizing in late summer as both of these practices may promote tender new growth not properly hardened off and prepared for the winter.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Protecting Branches</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Heavy snow and ice can deform or break branches in upright arborvitaes, multi-stemmed trees, and those with poor branch unions or included bark. Properly pruned trees are less prone to these breakages. If still an issue, trees/shrubs and upright branches can be tied together using rope or twine. Lumber, snow fencing, and frames can also be used to support heavy snow and ice loads from above.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Trunk Protection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Sun scald on stems happens when newly planted or thin-barked trees such as cherry, linden, maple, or plum break dormancy on the bark. This usually occurs in areas exposed to sun such as the south or west sides of the trunk, or areas where lower branches have been pruned off. Use white tree wrap or white paint on the lower trunk from fall to spring in young trees and longer for those with thin bark. Rodents can also girdle the tree or shrub base by feeding on the cambium. Wrap the lower trunk base with cylinders or put up fences and barriers. This could be used to for both sun scald and rodent protection.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Root Protection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Roots are much less hardy than stems and crowns. Temperature fluctuations involving repeated warming and cooling can cause cracking from expansion and contraction. Young grafted plants are especially sensitive to bud union damage at their base. For these reasons, roots should often be of most concern regarding plant survival over winter months. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soil naturally remains warmer than surface temperatures and cools down much slower that the surface in winter. Ensuring your soil has adequate moisture retaining properties such as compost and organic matter can allow it to stay warmer since moist soil retains heat better than dry soil. Applying 3-4 inches of mulch, using a thick layer of leaves/straw, or even leaving snow in thick layers can be a great way insulate and protect plants from from wind and extreme cold.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"winter protection for garden plants\" src=\"/uploads/articles/rob-evel-O2Pn6LBp6Y0-unsplash-258.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<figcaption><span>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@robevel?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Rob Evel</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/mulch?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></span></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<h3>Road Salt</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Salt spray from ploughs and traffic, also runoff from roads and cause cellular dehydration and be detrimental to certain woody plants. This can be prevent by avoiding excessive salt applications or using alternatives like calcium chloride, or calcium magnesium acetate. Barriers can also be used to block road and sidewalk salt sprays. Salt-tolerant trees/shrubs should be planted in vulnerable areas like roadsides and walkways. Some native North American salt tolerant trees include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>Red oak</li>\r\n <li>White oak</li>\r\n <li>Black cherry</li>\r\n <li>Jack pine</li>\r\n <li>Black locust</li>\r\n <li>American buckeye</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Last Words</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If some winter trauma does occur, prune out damaged plant material in late spring or summer after new growth appears. Plants are resilient, and will attempt to correct themselves if given the chance. Again, I prefer to select native plants as a first choice, and other cold hardy non-native alternatives as a second. This, along with good cultural practices, proper planning, and protection will give your woody plants the upper hand in battling winter ice, snow, and freeze-thaw cycles.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"small-text\">\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown, F., University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources.

Nitrogen fertilizer is often used in landscaping as a means of promoting growth, health, and vitality in trees and plants. Though nitrogen definitely plays an important roll in the growth of trees, health and vitality may actually be somewhat compromised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In nature, trees have adapted to low nutrient conditions. As a result they may grow shorter, with sparser canopies, and a more efficient root system. They never seem to show any chlorosis (signs of nutrient deficiencies in leaves) as commonly found in landscapes or nurseries. The reason is that trees are quite good at allocating resources when they\'re less are available. For example, roots stretch further and become more dense to gather nutrition from as much area as possible. Canopy growth slows and reserves are kept for potential pathogens and stress tolerance. Smaller leaves are produced, nitrogen is primarily used for photosynthesis, and leaf density is created by other compounds instead of nitrogen. Because of this, high rates of photosynthesis can still occur despite small leaf size. Trees overall become very efficient at using the little that they have.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"forest trees\" src=\"/uploads/articles/caleb-maxwell-fkLYuWE6c1s-unsplash-259.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption><span>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@caleb_maxwell?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Caleb Maxwell</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/tree-roots?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></span></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>When nitrogen (especially synthetic fertilizer) is introduced into the soil, trees no longer find the need to create larger, deeper root systems. Also, less secondary metabolites are produced which normally aid in drought stress protection. Trees become ill prepared for times of drought or the lack of more fertilizer since their roots are not prepared to search for it naturally in the ground. With nitrogen application, resources are also directed to use in canopy growth, creating more stems, leaves, and buds. This causes resources (carbon stores in the tree) to be used to create growth rather than compounds needed for self defence and storage reserves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rapid growth from nitrogen is a natural reaction plants have to their surroundings in nature. When nitrogen is available in high amounts, it\'s accepted that surrounding plants will also have it available and a faster production of leaves and stems is triggered to be able to compete with the growth of other plants. As a result, more focus is given to plant height or width and less to other processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using nitrogen fertilizer can also increase the activity of piercing-sucking insects such as aphids, scales, and mites on plant leaves and stems. It can also decrease resistance to chewing insects such as caterpillars, beetles, and borers.

(154, 'why-you-shouldnt-garden-in-wet-soil', 'Why You Shouldn\'t Garden In Wet Soil', '<p>In landscaping, agriculture, any many other industries, soil compaction can have negative effects on soil health and plant growth. This is especially true for high vehicle or foot traffic areas or those exposed to heavy machinery. It can take years to bring soil back to its natural state, so it\'s important to know its causes, what compaction does and how to avoid it.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"desolate soil\" src=\"/uploads/articles/dave-lowe-URrHCgHeJ9Q-unsplash-262.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption><span>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@davelowephoto?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Dave Lowe</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/compacted-soil?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></span></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<h3>What Compaction Does To Soil</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Soil should ideally consist of about 50% solids, 25% water, and 25% air. When compaction occurs soil particles press together reducing pore space. This changes its physical and chemical properties such as bulk density (weight for a given volume), infiltration rate, and soil elasticity. Compacted soils are slower to drain water and slower to absorb it, creating puddles and waterlogged situations. With less space for air pockets, the soil environment becomes un-livable for many beneficial soil organisms. Lack of oxygen increases the activity of anaerobic microbes which release plant-loving nitrogen into the atmosphere. The process is called denitrification, and it basically lowers soil nutrition.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"compacted soil\" src=\"/uploads/articles/markus-spiske-d4SLJNrU4rs-unsplash-265.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<figcaption><span>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@markusspiske?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Markus Spiske</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/turning-soil?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></span></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Since compaction makes soil more dense, it becomes harder for roots to force themselves through it. As a result, they develop shorter, less fibrous root systems. This usually affects the most desirable plants in landscapes such as vegetables and ornamentals. Weeds and invasives then dominate and take over since they have strong tap roots and can tolerate poor soil conditions. It\'s actually nature\'s\' method of de-compacting and conditioning the soil for successive generations of plants.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Causes Of Soil Compaction</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Soil is most vulnerable to compaction when in a \"plastic\" state, or just near maximum water capacity. When soil particles are lubricated, they slide more easily and are therefore less resistant to closing in on their pores, yet not so saturated that water can act as a cushion between particles. Soil enters the ideal condition for compaction to occur. For this reason, avoid working on wet soil, especially if it\'s not quite completely saturated or soaking wet yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"mud\" src=\"/uploads/articles/artem-maltsev-pf07Opq5Zx4-unsplash-267.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption><span>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@art_maltsev?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Artem Maltsev</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/mud?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></span></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Construction, agriculture, and the clearing of land removes plant material, exposing open soil to the elements. Plants are a natural buffer for rain impact on soil surfaces. Open ground caused by disturbed or abandoned land can allow the impact of continual rainfall to pound on open soil, causing compaction. This is especially true on clay sites that already have poor drainage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continuous tillage can also lead to eventual compaction because it breaks down soil aggregates, destroying soil structure. It can also create a compact hard pan just below the level of tillage if tilling is always performed at the same depth.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"farming\" src=\"/uploads/articles/clint-patterson-aj4-kxI932s-unsplash-266.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption><span>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@cbpsc1?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Clint Patterson</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/farm-tractor?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></span></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<h3>Fixing Compacted Soil</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Compacted soil can take some time to reverse. Adding organic matter will will increase microbial colonies, fungal networks, and worm populations. Promoting microbial activity creates soil aggregates (soil particles that bind together in stable units) which improve soil structure. Using an aerator will also allow air and nutrients through, increasing root growth, and decreasing anaerobic activity. Applying mulch will protect soil from rain and distribute the weight of foot traffic. Freeze thaw cycles have been said to be effective in de-compacting soil but this is rarely the case past a few inches from the surface.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"compost\" src=\"/uploads/articles/markus-spiske-71uUjIt3cIs-unsplash-264.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption><span>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@markusspiske?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Markus Spiske</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/collections/2057447/soil?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></span></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<h3>When Soil Compaction Is Necessary</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are occasional cases where intentional soil compaction is used and there are some benefits. Some seed crops are pressed into the ground to providing good seed to soil contact, allowing them to germinate more readily. Also, in a very light soil with little rainfall, compaction can help to retain moisture that would otherwise be lost.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Avoiding Soil Compaction</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The heavier the load, the deeper the compaction will go below the surface and harder it will be to relieve it. Maintain designated paths for heavy machinery, foot, or vehicle traffic, and use plywood boards or mulch to distribute the weight. Avoid working in the yard when soil is wet or wait for it to dry if at all possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"mulch\" src=\"/uploads/articles/paul-green-mGQfQe3EOBI-unsplash-263.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption><span>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@pgreen1983?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Paul Green</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/collections/2057447/soil?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></span></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"small-text\">\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Agri - Facts.

This includes forests, fields, outdoor gardens, and indoor plants. Many of us know about the physical benefits of trees and plants. These include carbon sequestration, air filtration, erosion control, shade, habitat, and many other qualities. But are there phycological benefits? Does their appearance, and fragrance have any impact on human wellbeing? Can the act of caring for trees and plants provide any phycological healing qualities to our ailments and disorders? It turn out, studies show they do.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"flowering tree\" src=\"/uploads/articles/mia-anderson-Nowjp0N5Zyw-unsplash-273.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption><span>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@miaanderson?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Mia Anderson</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/tree-flowers?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></span></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<h3>Plants In the Workplace</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Statistically, interior plants are known to increase the overall health and wellbeing of employees in the workplace. This includes the willingness of employees to work longer hours. As mammals, we have been spent most of our evolutionary history outside among plants. It\'s only natural that we would feel more comfortable and at home in an outdoor setting. Interior plants soften the harsh spaces, cubicles, offices, and facilities we\'re commonly subject to. Plants can make these spaces more welcoming and relatable from a visual point of view. Studies show a drop in absenteeism by 14% for areas of employment that use indoor plants to their advantage.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"indoor plants\" src=\"/uploads/articles/andre-guerra-7YhWiPR17d0-unsplash-268.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption><span>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@andredoesphoto?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Andre Guerra</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/indoor-plants?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></span></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>McDonald’s (1976) mentions “If you live and work with plants around you, there is always something that needs to be done for them and that will simultaneously help you get through everyday anxieties. As you wait for an important telephone call or recover from a difficult personal or professional confrontation, picking off dead leaves and flowers, watering a plant, or cleaning its leaves with a damp tissue can reduce anxiety far better than chain smoking, a stiff drink, or a tranquilizer.”\r\n(p. 20).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Researchers from Japan are taking plants seriously and have come up with the concept of \"forest bathing\". This involves the sectioning off of forested areas as an opportunity for the public to escape from urban life and take in nature with more of their senses (sight, smell, touch, sound). It came about as the result of studies proving reduction of heart rate, cortisol levels, and cancer susceptibility in those who regularly ventured outside in natural settings.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"forest\" src=\"/uploads/articles/trail-5yOnGsKUNGw-unsplash-1-269.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<figcaption><span>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@trails?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">trail</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/forests?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></span></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Trees are often planted beside highways not only as a visual barriers but as a means of noise reduction. Though the actual amount of noise reduced by trees and plants is minimal, noise is instead reduced in an indirect way. Evidence suggests that plants create a psychological barrier, reducing the perception of noise. Viewing trees or plants instead of highways and construction, creates a an \"out of sight, out of mind\" state where noise seems to be reduced.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Caring For Plants</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Caring for trees, plants, and green spaces evoke passionate emotions that relieve the mental fatigue we experience in modern urban life. Besides curb appeal, the act of gardening has multiple benefits, many of which can be accomplished at the same time. These include physical activity, meditation, visual therapy, goal setting, metaphorical life lessons, growing fruit or vegetables for food, and many more. It\'s no surprise that two thirds of Canadians list gardening as their favourite hobby. Working with plants can also be a wholesome family activity. Kids can get happily involved, and much in horticulture is flexible and forgiving; if one plant fails another can takes its place. There\'s always second and third chances for mistakes, and there\'s always \"room to grow\".</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"gardening\" src=\"/uploads/articles/paige-cody-z8gKIE4Kz0Y-unsplash-270.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption><span>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@paige_cody?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Paige Cody</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/gardening?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></span></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Growers obtain the health benefits of exercise while working with plants. Gardening provides not only mental relief, but fitness at the same time. Bending, pruning, and repotting are just a few of the physical activities involved that all horticulturalists can benefit from.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Relief From Hospitalization</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies show that people in hospitals are more relaxed and recover faster when plants are present. In a study (Ulrich\r\n1986), patients who were situated in an area with a view of a wooded scene recovered faster from surgery, had\r\nfewer complications, and required less pain medication than those with the view blocked by the side of a building. \r\n“Nature therapy can lead to a state of physiological and psychological relaxation in patients with SCI” (Ochiai, H., Song, C., Ikei, H., Imai, M., Miyazaki, Y., 2017). </p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"hospital bed\" src=\"/uploads/articles/logan-nolin-EvceCyopkKI-unsplash-271.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption><span>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@logannolin?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Logan Nolin</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/bonsai-care?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></span></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Many claim to have been partly healed from traumatic experiences through plant care. Herman (2016) states: “During the group, participants were encouraged to talk about their traumatic experiences. Many stated that it was easier to talk about horrific incidents while ‘working’ on their bonsai tree.”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plants continually clean the air, reducing headaches, fatigue, asthma, and infections from those working indoors. They have show to reduce indoor airborne molds and bacteria by up to 60%, and can reduce sore throats and headache complaints by as much as 23%.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Symbolic Benefits Of Plants</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Trees are a living artform that can promote the physical and phycological healing of both body and spirit. Planting a tree is often done as a symbol of a pivotal point in life. Looking at the same tree at a later time can be a form of remembering that stage of life. “What makes bonsai different is being able to take your tree with you: when you move, go to university, get married, get divorced. It can always, as long as it lives, be with you.”, (Hermann C. 2016).</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"bonsai\" src=\"/uploads/articles/gang-jiang-3wrk3oEPhAY-unsplash-272.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<figcaption><span>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@qingyawangyue?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Gang Jiang</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/bonsai-care?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></span></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Creative plant arrangements have many fulfilling benefits such as artistic creativity. Art, in its many forms have long been a means of stress relief and neurological balancing. The shaping of these tiny landscapes can be an outlet of artistic expression and experimentation that constantly changes as it grows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The phycological benefits of plants may seem of little importance, but without them we find ourselves more unhealthy, stressed, ill, and overall unhappy for unknown reasons. Plants effect us on a deeper level than we may be aware. Why not put it to the test? Bring a plant to your office, work out in the garden, plant a tree in your backyard and see how you feel. </p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"small-text\">\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Ali Khan, M., Amin, N., Khan, A. et al.

They can grow to nearly two inches in length. Normally not a big deal though.

To make the tea, the berries should be dried first. This can be done using a dehydrator, the oven, or simply by laying them out in front of a sunny window for about a week (depending on how sunny it is).</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"hawthorn berries\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230809_021414303-289.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Add a tablespoon per cup of boiling water, then simmer for about 30 minutes. The water will turn a nice orange to red colour. In my oppinion, the aroma is absolutely fantastic, and hard to describe.

Method #1 is easier while method #2 involves extracting the seed if you need to store them or propagate them as seed starts or \"plugs\" for example. The fruity membrane or \"flesh\" of the berry or fruit inhibit germination, so extracting it is needed in order for seeds to sprout.

This can be as simple as planting the whole ripe berry directly in the ground and letting it grow from there. Microbes in the soil naturally ferment the fruit away, releasing the seed(s) within. The drawbacks are potential animals digging them up, and what about berries that have dozens of seeds per fruit? Since they\'re planted in one place, crowding is likely to happen, only one or two plants may survive per berry. </p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"Fermenting berries for seed\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20231123_235658298.TS_exported_100_1701464523518-302.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>I like to assist the seed survival a little by fermenting them in bags then placing the bags in a storage bin outside for the winter. Occasionally checking on them to make sure the soil is moist is all that really has to be done during storage. Closer to spring, fruit flesh will be completely decomposed and the seed-filled soil mix can be spread over a propagation tray. Rooted seeds will then need to be transplanted out to give them space to grow individually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Method #2, Extracting\r\nFor this method, the seeds will be physically extracted. As mentioned, you\'d need to do this if you want to store the seeds themselves or need more control over planting individual plants. Make sure the seeds are ripe, it also helps to let them sit a couple days after you pick them.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"Seed separation using a blender\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20231121_221234761.TS_exported_0-300.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Soak the seeds in water and macerate them. Use a blender of some kind, this can be a hand held or stationary. You can file the blades down to avoid damaging the seeds but most people don\'t have a spare blender lying around to ruin, and I find the damage is usually minimal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once blended, add water. Floating pulp and less viable seeds can be poured off, while more viable seeds sink to the bottom. Repeat by adding water and pouring off the residue until left with mostly seeds at the bottom. Strain them and lay them out on a surface to dry for 24 to 48 hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If there are still pieces of pulp, they can be sifted in a screen or just remove as much dried fruit residue as you can. They\'ll then need to be stratified to simulate cold weather for a few months. Do this by mixing half seed with half perlite, vermiculite, or potting soil. Perlite is nice because it\'s sterile and you can usually see the seeds well. </p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"Seed screening\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20231123_234706153.TS_exported_2167-301.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Store them in sealed ziplock bags in the fridge for 3 to 4 months. Be sure to check up on them now and then to make sure they stay moist. If you see mold, you can spray them with a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution. In spring, spread the mixture on seed trays, perlite and all. This way there\'s no need to separate the seeds from the mix. When they sprout, they\'ll need to be transplanted or spaced out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A couple things to consider... Some fruit like service berry need to skip the drying out step since they need to stay moist through the whole process. Also, some species like baneberry need double dormancy, and will take two seasons to germinate. If you are dealing with delicate seeds, they may not do well in the blender. However, most berries and even berry-like seed pods will do fine using these above methods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As plant people, we can do our best at research, but sometimes the answers are a challenge to find, especially for very particular things. Sometimes the best advice if you\'re unsure if something will grow or not is to just go ahead and try it. If it doesn\'t work try something else. If nature can do it, you should be able to as well. Observe how it\'s done in nature, listen to what it tells you and try to mimic the natrual process.</p>', '[{\"id\":\"297\",\"name\":\"PXL_20230806_022344967-297.jpg\",\"tag\":\"1\",\"description\":\"Wild Rose Seeds\",\"caption\":\"Wild Rose Seeds\",\"tag_name\":\"featured\"},{\"id\":\"298\",\"name\":\"PXL_20230805_155119907-298.jpg\",\"tag\":\"1\",\"description\":\"Choke Cherry\",\"caption\":\"Choke Cherry\",\"tag_name\":\"featured\"},{\"id\":\"300\",\"name\":\"PXL_20231121_221234761.TS_exported_0-300.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Seed separation using a blender\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"},{\"id\":\"301\",\"name\":\"PXL_20231123_234706153.TS_exported_2167-301.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Seed screening\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"},{\"id\":\"302\",\"name\":\"PXL_20231123_235658298.TS_exported_100_1701464523518-302.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Fermenting berries for seed\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"}]', 2, '2023-11-27', NULL),

Gentle instrumental music with piano main(1399913) - sorateras</a> </section> </blockquote> <script async src=\"https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js\"></script>\r\n\r\n<p>Oregon grape is not a type of grape or holly but rather in the barberry family. You may be familiar with Japanese barberry, a purplish-red, spiny ornamental often used in landscaping. In the Pacific North West there\'s three types: \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>Mahonia aquifolium (taller and more shrub-like)</li>\r\n <li>Mahonia repens (low and spreading by rhizomes)</li>\r\n <li>M. nervosa (in mature Douglas fir and Western red cedar forests)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>M. aquifolium seems to be the type commonly found here in northern BC but it seems to be a lower ground cover than the shrub versions seen in the south (I wonder if it\'s hybridized with M. Repens since these plants do hybridize easily). Like Japanese barberry, Oregon grape is often sought after in landscaping. Shinny, interesting-shaped evergreen leaves, blue berries, and yellow flowers give it year-round interest, especially in shaded woodland areas where it naturally grows. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was even more interested when I heard about the medical actions Oregon grape is known for. There are different species of this plant that grow natively in Asia as well as the Americas. For centuries, it\'s been used in Chinese medicine as well as by Native Americans for food, medicine and even as a dye for basketry. All parts are edible, even the berries but they\'re quite bitter (good for jams, wine, and pies). The yellow spring flowers are even edible and slightly sweet along with the bitterness. Teas, tinctures, and salves can be made from Oregon grape to relieve skin and stomach ailments.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the plant constituents or \'medicines\' are in the root cambium, where it identifies it\'s self in a bright yellow color, (berberinic acid), The alkaloid berberine is one of its key components; widely used in herbal medicine and found in other plant species such as golden seal and barberry. </p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"Oregon grape in forest\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20231024_190808086-304.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<h3>Psoriasis</h3>\r\n<p>The antifungal and antibacterial properties of Berberine help with infected skin caused by psoriasis and other skin conditions. Berberine is even effective against graham negative bacteria, the most difficult type of bacteria to treat. The plant is said to slow production of psoriasis cells and reduce inflammation on the skin and taking it internally is said to help battle psoriasis from the inside out.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Stomach Issues</h3>\r\n<p>Internally, Oregon grape not only helps with psoriasis, but also stomach, intestinal, and gallbladder issues. As a bitter, it acts as a tonic for liver stimulation, cleansing, and detoxifying. A couple drops of tincture taken a few minutes before meals triggers bile production in the body, relieving Indigestion and bloating issues. Bile helps to break down the fat in food efficiently, making it readily available for our cells to use. Oregon grape\'s berberine constituent also helps regulate fat cells and some even claim it to remedy weight loss.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Harvesting</h3>\r\n<p>Unlike goldenseal, Oregon grape is usually abundant and not over harvested. It spreads by rhizomes so when a plant is cut off from the colony, more can grow back in its place. You can also harvest in winter when nutrients are brought from the canopy down into the roots. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harvest by first giving an offering of some kind in thankfulness. This may be tobacco or a prayer, some hair, etc. whole plants can be dug up with roots exposed and thoroughly cleaned. Simply chewing on the roots is the simplist way to take it in, but most people use this method:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n <li>Use a knife or peeler to carve away the outer bark to reveal the bright yellow color underneath.</li>\r\n <li>Carve this bright yellow inner bark into a bowl to use for medicine</li>\r\n <li>Discard the outer bark and the heart wood stem</li>\r\n <li>Dry the inner bark for later use or use them fresh in a tea, tincture, or salve</li>\r\n <li>Optionally dry then grind it into a powder for a poultice, or for tea</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>All parts of the plant are usable but the roots and lower stem is where you\'ll find the nice yellow medicinal berberine. Just make sure to carve it while it\'s fresh, as it hardens if you wait too long.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Precautions</h3>\r\n<p>Oregon grape is generally considered safe, but there are some precautions to follow like any medical herb. Try in small amounts at first Incase of any allergic reactions, and consider consulting a health care professional before using, especially if taking with other medications.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\'ve heard to be cautious using it if pregnant or on young children and elderly, and have also heard it\'s safe for children especially since it\'s milder than goldenseal. Either way, consulting a health professional and doing research is best. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oregon grape is great for cleansing, and detoxifying the body, It will target bad microbes like yeasts and candida, but over time it can wipe out good microbes too so don\'t take it excessively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I get a lot of Joy in sustainably harvesting native plants from the forest and using them for the health and well-being of myself and family. As always, be sure to properly identify and use it with care. Also, Oregon grape does no work for everyone\'s psoriasis, but many claim it has done wonders, not only for their skin but for many other ailments. Don\'t be afraid to give it a try!</p>', '[{\"id\":\"303\",\"name\":\"PXL_20231024_185639408-303.jpg\",\"tag\":\"1\",\"description\":\"Oregon grape, Mahonia aquifolium\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"featured\"},{\"id\":\"304\",\"name\":\"PXL_20231024_190808086-304.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Oregon grape in forest\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"}]', 2, '2023-12-12', NULL),

It grew up to 115 feet tall with a trunk diameter well over 10 feet. Its range stretched from Georgia to Michigan in the United Stated and Plentiful in South western Ontario. Now most chestnuts are short-lived, less than 33 feet tall, and grow from resprouting at the base (a stress response). They are now rare and endangered in Canada and the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"American chestnut trunk\" src=\"/uploads/articles/1024px-Castanea_dentata_JPG1b-307.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<figcaption><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Castanea_dentata_JPG1b.jpg\">Jean-Pol GRANDMONT</a>, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0\">CC BY-SA 3.0</a>, via Wikimedia Commons</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>The decline of the American chestnut started with ink disease of the 1800\'s, which killed off the southern portion of the tree\'s range.\r\nThe Fungal pathogen, chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica) then came from Asia in early 20th century, which turned the tree from plentiful to rare. The disease feeds off of the trunk\'s cambium, girdling it and eventually killing the tree. Attempts have been made to locate surviving trees and restore them for over 30 years. Now, after decades of breeding, The American Chestnut Foundation is close to producing blight-resistant specimens to release into the wild. A virus is also being developed using Genetic engineering aiming to infect the chestnut blight fungus in an attempt to stop its spread.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"American chestnut leaves and fruit\" src=\"/uploads/articles/NAS-104_Castanea_dentata-311.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<figcaption><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NAS-104_Castanea_dentata.png\">François André Michaux (book author), Augustus Lucas Hillhouse (translator), iii (illustrator), eee (engraver)</a>, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Leaves have a distinctive large, bristle-tipped outer edge which resembling saw teeth.

Perhaps known best for its distinctive \'army camo\' bark and interesting large horizontal branches; the bark displays off-white, green, and cream coloured underlayers. A loose dark outer layer peels in flakes. Found in scattered locations throughout eastern North America, sycamore grows mainly in bottomland forests with elm, ash, and cottonwood. The tree can sometimes act as a pioneer species in disturbed areas with adequate moisture or in uplands with oak and hickory. Sycamore is widely planted in landscapes and urban areas where adequate space to grow is provided. The shape is tall, Round and wide spreading. Shallow, fibrours roots sometimes invade pipes and foundations as willows do.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"American sycamore seeds\" src=\"/uploads/articles/1024px-Platanus_occidentalis-_3460-317.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<figcaption><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Platanus_occidentalis-_3460.jpg\">Colsu</a>, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0\">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>, via Wikimedia Commons</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Leaves have 3 to five lobes and resemble those of a maple tree. Stipules (leaf like attachments) are notably at the base of each leaf stalk. Ball-shaped fruiting bodies are born singular, this helps to differentiate American sycamore from the London plane tree (platanus x acerifolia), which produced them in pairs. Seed like fruits are held together on the fruiting body and are hairy towards the ball\'s center. This allows them to be caught in the wind when broken apart. Sycamore wood is valuable for furniture, interiors, crates, pulp wood, and other applications. Though heavy and hard, the grain is twisted and not very structurally strong.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"small-text\">\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Arboretum - University of Guelph. (n.d ).

It can be found in swamps, bogs, thickets, and sometimes on uplands. It has a suckering colonial growth habit; adaptable to a variety of soil types, but prefers moist to wet soil on the acidic side. The fruits have use both to humans and wildlife. Both flowering and fruiting have proven their appeal in the landscaping industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"black chokeberry flowers\" src=\"/uploads/articles/Aronia_melanocarpa_WFNY-103-346.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<figcaption><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Aronia_melanocarpa_WFNY-103.jpg\">Homer D.

The best flowering and fruit production occurs when planted in full sun. In August, clusters of showy black blueberry sized fruit (pomes) follow flowering. Each fruit contains 1 to 5 seeds. The leaves are glossy and elliptic to obovate; dark green in colour and with finely toothed margins. The fall colour is a nice reddish purple. Branches become a bit leggy towards the bottom of the shrub and bark is smooth with conspicuous lenticels as seen with other cherries. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chokeberry provides food for wildlife and humans in various ways. Fruit can persist into the winter and is eaten by birds and various animal species. The twigs and leaves are also browsed by deer and rabbits. The name chokeberry refers to a tart and bitter taste of the berries despite the fact they\'re edible. Better suited cooked, the fruit is sometimes used to make jams and jellies, juice and wine. Higher levels of antioxidants than any other temperate fruit has made chokeberry more popular for production in recent years and is grown commercially in Europe for various juices and beverages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chokeberry can be used in landscapes as a mixed border, massing, hedge or by water in wetland reclamation projects due to its tolerance of wet feet. Cultivars have been developed to reduce suckering, produce abundant fruits/flowers, and enhance fall colour. Popular cultivars include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>‘Autumn Magic’</li>\r\n <li>Iroquois Beauty™</li>\r\n <li>‘Viking’</li>\r\n <li>var. elata</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"small-text\">\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Missouri Botanical Garden.

Usually it is found in tall grass prairies but can grow in heavier soils. The overall shape is irregular to round, Reaching up to 65ft in height with a 3ft trunk diameter. Black oak is similar to red oak (Quercus rubra) with a few differences in the leaves, bark and cambium.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"winter black oak\" src=\"/uploads/articles/original-349.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<figcaption>© Grace Calderwood, some rights reserved (CC-BY-NC)</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Leaves are shinny dark green on the upper surface and yellow-brown on the lower surface. The texture is rough; hairy early in the season and with bristle tips. Clusters of end buds are gray, pointed, and covered in wooly hairs. Black oak usually has fewer, Deeper lobes than that of red oak.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"black oak bark\" src=\"/uploads/articles/original-350.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<figcaption>© William Weaver, all rights reserved</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>The tree\'s dark gray bark becomes near black with age. Mature bark produces blocky squares whereas red oak has long vertical furrows. Orange Inner bark of the black oak contains quercitron which can be used as a yellow dye. This also differentiates it from red oak. Acorns are 1 - 2cm equally long as wide. A slightly hairy bowl-shaped cup covers half the nut. They are dispersed as food by birds, white tailed deer and other wildlife.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Black oak is intolerant of shade and competition with other tree species. It also has a long taproot which prevents it from what is considered easy to transplant in the landscaping world. Proper growing techniques can, however, alleviate this issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"small-text\">\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Jill and Olivia\'s guide to deciduous trees of the Northeast.

Other names for it you may come across are goose grass, bedstraw, sticky willy, and catchweed. You may know it as a floppy plant that acts like velcro as it sticks to clothing and other plants for support and spread its seeds. Because of Cleaver\'s abundance and distribution, it\'s thought of as a noxious weed in many areas; but cleaver is actually a highly nutritious and beneficial plant in many ways, and has been widely used in Asia, Europe, and North America for food and medicine for a long time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"Cleaver\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230729_155922876-305.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"Cleaver weed\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230802_002548173-306.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<h3>Identification</h3>\r\n<p>Clever can be identified by whorls of thin leaves surrounding a square stem. It\'s usually a small upright plant , but can also grow longer when along the ground or climbing up other plants. Small Hairs on the leaves and stems enable it have this clinging action and velcro was actually invented by studying how these hairs work. Sometimes Small, four petaled flowers appear and are a great additional identifying feature. I should also mention, there\'s many types of cleavers, some without sticky leaves/stems such as northern bedstraw (Galium boreale), but the above features are good indications if your plant is a clever.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Cleaver seeds\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230829_215607122-307.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Medicinal Actions</h3>\r\n<p>Clever\'s strength is in its cleansing, detoxifying properties, especially as a cooling herb to take during summer months. It works to purify the blood, lymph nodes, and body from Inflammation and poisons. In this way, it can be used as a tonic for overall health and well-being. You can also use it as a poultice or cream for inflammatory skin conditions like psoriasis, and dandruff issues. Its also been used for:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>fevers</li>\r\n <li>tonsillitis </li>\r\n <li>prostate health</li>\r\n <li>urinary problems</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Harvesting</h3>\r\n<p>Cleaver can be dried but is best used fresh where possible, to preserve its beneficial nutrients and compounds. Harvesting is best done in early spring or early autumn where leaves and stems (preferably young shoots) Can be gathered using a sharp knife or shears. When harvesting wild food and medicine, it\'s always good to give thanks in some way, whether it be an offering or prayer.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Preparations</h3>\r\n<p>Cleaver can be prepared in many ways. A tea, Infusion, tincture, compress, oil, cream, or hair rinse can be made from the stems and leaves.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"Cleaver leaves\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230829_220003483-308.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<h3>Other Uses</h3>\r\n<p>Some eat the young shoots raw, or cook them in soups or stews. The greenery can also be juiced to healthify summer drinks. Since clever is In the coffee family, the small hairy seeds can be toasted and ground to make a coffee alternative. Historically, the dried plant was used to stuff mattresses and pillows, hence the name \"bedstraw\", infact it is said this was used to make bedding for the newly born baby Jesus Christ.</p>\r\n\r\n\"Dream pillow vid\"\r\n\r\n<p>Early settlers used clever to filter their cow\'s milk, using the tangled plants as sieves for impurities, while adding in the plant\'s nutritional benefits at the same time. Roots were also used to make a red dye.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Precautions</h3>\r\n<p>Always do research to properly identify the plant when harvesting (I usually use at least three different sources). When using wild plants as medicine, it\'s also a good idea to try it in small amounts at first to see how your body reacts. It\'s best to not overdose in amount or extensive repeated use, but clever is a gentle and generally safe herb to use.</p>', '[{\"id\":\"305\",\"name\":\"PXL_20230729_155922876-305.jpg\",\"tag\":\"1\",\"description\":\"Cleaver\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"featured\"},{\"id\":\"306\",\"name\":\"PXL_20230802_002548173-306.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Cleaver weed\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"},{\"id\":\"307\",\"name\":\"PXL_20230829_215607122-307.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Cleaver seeds\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"},{\"id\":\"308\",\"name\":\"PXL_20230829_220003483-308.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Cleaver leaves\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"}]', 2, '2023-12-19', NULL),

This is due to the fatal fungal disease butternut dieback or butternut canker. Butternut is similar to black walnut (Juglans nigra) but with less fissured bark, fewer leaflets, and more oval shaped fruit. Its also slightly smaller (60 feet, but occasionally 100 feet) and lives generally farther northward than black walnut. The Crown is broad and irregular in outline and rounded at the top. A low branching trunk with large forked branches appear to droop and curve up at the ends. Butternut grows in moist, well drained soil and intolerant of shade</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"butternut\" src=\"/uploads/articles/butternut_4-365.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The leaves are compound and up to 20 inches long, with oblong to lanceolate leaflets, 11 to 17 in number. Leaf color is yellowish green and hairy underneath (unlike the black walnut). One identifying feature of the tree is the dark brown chambers seen in twig piths when split open. From May to June, yellowish green male drooping catkins, and short female flower spikes occur. The fruit consists of clusters of indehiscent green oval husks which mature in the fall. A single Nut exist within the husk and is encased in a tough shell with a small edible kernel inside. The taste is quite favorable and has a buttery oil, hence the name \'butternut\'. </p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"butternut\" src=\"/uploads/articles/butternut_1-363.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"butternut buds\" src=\"/uploads/articles/butternut_6-367.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The sap of the butternut tree can be boiled down into a syrup. Currently, the nuts are popular for making maple-butternut candy amongst other snacks. Other uses include a yellowish orange dye which can be made from the nut husks. The root cambium can also be used medicinally. Transplanting can be tricky for butternut as with other walnut trees due to the long taproot, but possible with proper growing techniques. As with the black walnut, the tree produces juglones, which inhibits the growth of some other plants surrounding it.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"butternut fruit\" src=\"/uploads/articles/butternut_5-366.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"small-text\">\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.

As a tree more widespread in the United States, It is restricted to a few patches in Southern Ontario. The cottonwood is a very fast growing weak-wooded tree reaching to 4 - 6 ft in diameter. Because of this and its messy seed dispersal and vigorous root system, it is not recommended for tight urban spaces. In an open or country setting, however, the tree can be a beautiful landscape specimen.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"eastern cottonwood bark\" src=\"/uploads/articles/20200822_171808-390.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The eastern cottonwood can be identified by its deeply ridged and furrowed bark, cottony seed tufts (on female trees), and triangular toothed leaves. Its Leaves are often used to feed livestock due to their high protein content. Cottonwoods are Dioecious, producing either make or female catkins. Like other poplars they easily hybridized with other species which can present a challenge for identification. </p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"eastern cottonwood habit\" src=\"/uploads/articles/20200822_171829-391.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"small-text\">\r\n\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Arboretum, (n.d.).

This prominent and very easy to identify plant can be found all over the world, mainly in dry, sandy, and disturbed areas. You May notice it on Roadsides, in abandoned lots, or forest edge, solitary, or in scattered colonies . Though native to Europe, Asia, and northern Africa, mullein has become so plentiful its now naturalized here in North America.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Mullein field\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230826_171612381-310.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<p>It was introduced into North America for medicinal use and as a fish poison (piscicide). Often thought as a noxious weed though it\'s not too invasive and is occasionally grown as an ornamental. This plant has a long history of medicinal use as it was used in Ancient times in Europe, traditional Chinese medicine, and is still widely used today.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@naturewithus_/video/7319907927496609030\" data-video-id=\"7319907927496609030\" style=\"max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;\" > <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@naturewithus_\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@naturewithus_?refer=embed\">@naturewithus_</a> Medicinal Mullein <a title=\"herbalmedicine\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/herbalmedicine?refer=embed\">#herbalmedicine</a> <a title=\"tuberculosis\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/tuberculosis?refer=embed\">#tuberculosis</a> <a title=\"naturalcoughremedy\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/naturalcoughremedy?refer=embed\">#naturalcoughremedy</a> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"?

Will to Live - Jacob Yoffee</a> </section> </blockquote> <script async src=\"https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js\"></script>\r\n\r\n<h3>Identification</h3>\r\n<p>A Basal rosette of large fuzzy leaves appear in its first year of growth. Think of the resemblance to cilia hairs linning the lungs; it can help you remember the use of this plant. In the second year of growth mullein shoots up a flower stalk roughly 7ft tall. A Raceme of yellow flowers appear from June to September, sowing up in a rather random fashion. Flowers then die, leaving a dead standing stalk. Seeds remain viable until the next soil disturbance, this can be for decades or even centuries!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"Mullein plant\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230826_164136033-313.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<h3>Medicinal Actons</h3>\r\n<p>Mullein is well known for treating dry cough, pneumonia, and bronchial issues. Used as an expectorant, it helps expel mucus and soothes mucous membranes, moving toxins out of the lungs. This makes mullein a good choice for irritateing cough, congestion, asthma, and lung disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mullein is also great externally as an oil or cream to treat joint issues, rheuma-tism, and sore muscles. Use on the skin for ear aches, eczema, rashes, splinters, and other skin conditions. The soft fuzzy leaves Can be even applied to babies as a diaper or used as toilet paper while in the wilderness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mullein has anti-viral and antibacterial properies that help fight both gram positive and *gram negative bacteria. These abilities have been used historically to treat tuberculosis, and positive results are causing physicians look to mullein once again for this purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides what mullein is widely accepted for, there are other uses including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>migraines</li>\r\n <li>constipation</li>\r\n <li>gout</li>\r\n <li>sleep</li>\r\n <li>diarrhea</li>\r\n <li>back spasms</li>\r\n <li>general health</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Harvesting</h3>\r\n<p>Leaves, flowers, roots can be harvested anytime when the plant has not turned brown. Flowers can be eaten raw and have a slight sweetness; leaves can be chewed. The second year leaves are just as good. Just lay them out to dry or they also do well in a dehydrator. If air drying, it may need several days since leaves are thick. It helps to remove the midrib since it\'s thicker than the rest of the leaf.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Preparations</h3>\r\n<p>Plant parts can be used fresh or dried in a:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>tea</li>\r\n <li>tincture</li>\r\n <li>extract</li>\r\n <li>capsule</li>\r\n <li>poultice</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Leaves or flowers can be infused in an oil for topical use on the skin or for ear aches. Dried leaves can be burned, smoked, and inhaled for respiratory ailments or blown into the ear for ear ailments. As such, dried mullein is very flammable, and the dead plant is a great tinder; in the past it would be wrapped in cloth and used as a torch.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"Dead Mullein stalk\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230527_013349825-311.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>One of its most popular preparations is as a tea: simply add 1 tablespoon of dried leaves or flowers to boiled water then steep for 10 minutes. Teas or tinctures can be taken three or four times a day. Fine leaf hairs dislodged in mullein tea may irritate some so running it through a coffee strainer may be necessary. Though great on it\'s own, mullein in combination with other herbs like licorice root is a great way to fight congestion during flu season.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"Mullein leaves\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230826_164704545-312.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Mullein is high in vitamins, minerals, and fatty acids. Other uses besides medicine is as a side in soups stews, or stir frys. Its benefitial constituents include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>Flavonoids</li>\r\n <li>Antioxidants</li>\r\n <li>Betacarotine</li>\r\n <li>Carotanoids</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Also high in:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>Potassium</li>\r\n <li>Magnesium</li>\r\n <li>iron</li>\r\n <li>Zink </li>\r\n <li>B5</li>\r\n <li>B2</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Precautions</h3>\r\n<p>Generally a safe herb. Some people may react or have skin irritations from the fine wool on the leaves. Other minor side effects may include upset stomach or diarrhea. Try in small amounts at first to ensure you have no allergic reactions. Don\'t consume the seeds, they may be toxic. There isn\'t sufficient evidence against use for those with kidney or liver disease, pregnant or breastfeeding mothers, or those of ill health but it\'s always a good idea to avoid use or consult a health professional if these apply to you.</p>', '[{\"id\":\"309\",\"name\":\"PXL_20230826_164650081-309.jpg\",\"tag\":\"1\",\"description\":\"Mullein flowers\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"featured\"},{\"id\":\"310\",\"name\":\"PXL_20230826_171612381-310.jpg\",\"tag\":\"1\",\"description\":\"Mullein field\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"featured\"},{\"id\":\"311\",\"name\":\"PXL_20230527_013349825-311.jpg\",\"tag\":\"1\",\"description\":\"Dead Mullein stalk\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"featured\"},{\"id\":\"312\",\"name\":\"PXL_20230826_164704545-312.jpg\",\"tag\":\"1\",\"description\":\"Mullein leaves\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"featured\"},{\"id\":\"313\",\"name\":\"PXL_20230826_164136033-313.jpg\",\"tag\":\"1\",\"description\":\"Mullein plant\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"featured\"}]', 2, '2023-12-23', NULL),

Its shape is compact and pyramidal when young, changing to a loose and open habit when older. Eastern White Pine are the tallest trees in Ontario and Eastern North America. They are abundant in the wild and are often used in the landscape. Provided proper drainage, the tree can grow in a variety of soils, but is salt sensitive.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Eastern White Pine forest\" src=\"/uploads/trees/eastern-white-pine-forest-90.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Needles & Branches</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nLong, flexible needles consisting of 5 needles per fascicle.

As a bushy shrub, it spreads by rhizomes, usually growing 4 to 10 feet in height but can reach up to almost 30 feet. It can be found near ponds and stream banks, in wet areas, or open woods with full to moderate sun exposure. Gray dogwood does well in border, mass or naturalized plantings due to its attractive flowers, fruit, and fall colour.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"gray dogwood fall colour\" src=\"/uploads/articles/gray-dogwood-fall-399.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption>© Rob Curtis, some rights reserved (CC-BY-NC-SA)</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Dense mounds of branches often form thickets with younger stems reddish and older stems grayish brown. The leaves are Grayish green, elliptic to lance in shape and are important forage for white tailed deer. From May to July, clusters of Showy flowers in open cymes or racemes (hence the name racemosa) appear, reproducing both sexually and asexually. Clusters of white berries mature from August to October and are favorite by many bird species.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"gray dogwood flowers\" src=\"/uploads/articles/1024px-Cornus_racemosa_3267567280-396.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cornus_racemosa_(3267567280).jpg\">Frank Mayfield (gmayfield10)</a>, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0\">CC BY-SA 2.0</a>, via Wikimedia Commons</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Gray dogwood has good pest and disease resistance, is tolerant of air pollution, and tolerant of a wide range of soil conditions.

The tree is very shade tolerant, slow growing, and fairly short-lived. With a wide spreading crown, it reaches up to 39ft in height and 1ft in trunk diameter. Hop hornbeam is often found in well-drained slopes and ridges of the forest understory. It prefers partial shade, but tolerates full sun if kept moist. Slightly acidic, well drained conditions are ideal but it thrives on many soil types.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"Hop Hornbeam\" src=\"/uploads/articles/1024px-Ostrya_virginiana_var._virginiana_Eastern_Hop_Hornbeam_1226_A_37484730726-415.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<figcaption><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ostrya_virginiana_var._virginiana_(Eastern_Hop_Hornbeam)_1226*A_(37484730726).jpg\">Plant Image Library from Boston, USA</a>, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0\">CC BY-SA 2.0</a>, via Wikimedia Commons</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Leaves oval shaped (elliptic), tapering towards the tip, and rounded or indented at the base.

Kentucky coffeetree is also noted to be one of the last to leaf out in the spring, and one of the first to drop leaves in the fall, hence it\'s botanical name meaning \'naked branch\'. The Stems are thick, and twig piths are wide and pink to brown in colour. Bark on semi-mature branches are rough, flaky and scaly. From May to early June, pyramidal clusters of fragrant greenish white flowers appear. Large, dark, bean-like seed pods follow flowering, containing 5 to 7 seeds which persist into winter. </p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"Kentucky Coffeetree\" src=\"/uploads/articles/1024px-Baden-Baden-Gymnocladus_dioicus-86-Geweihbaum-Frucht-2012-gje-421.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Baden-Baden-Gymnocladus_dioicus-86-Geweihbaum-Frucht-2012-gje.jpg\">Gerd Eichmann</a>, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0\">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>, via Wikimedia Commons</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>The name coffeetree was given by early settlers who would make a crude coffee substitute from them. However, the seeds are considered inedible (toxic) to humans, wildlife, and cattle. For this reason, roasting the seeds first is very important. As a dioecious tree (either male or female) reproduction can\'t occur without a male and female tree within close proximity. This along with the destruction of habitat and waterways (for seed dispersal), have made Kentucky coffeetree a species at risk in Ontario.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"small-text\">\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Arborday Founation.

Considered inconspicuous, the flowers are not easily seen and usually covered by foliage. Flowers have a peculiar way of assisting pollination. Hairs within them temporarily trap insects, collecting their pollen residue, then releasing them with the new flower residue after fertilization. Black to coppery brown fruit follow flowering and ripen from August to September.

The tree often forms colonies when found but is rare in Canada and scattered in distribution. Interestingly, it can be trained as a single stemmed tree or dense thicket depending on pruning strategies. The tree\'s natural form ranges from rounded to irregular. Sassafras albidum is the only species for its genus native to North America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Uniquely shaped leaves of the tree resemble mittens. Four potential shape variations occur on the same tree: a right handed mitten, left handed mitten, one with three lobes, and a plain oval. Leaves turn to an attractive yellow, orange, red, scarlet, or purple colour in autumn. The bark is orange-brown with deep furrows and soft corky ridges developing when mature. Leaves, bark, and any other parts of the plant release a Spicy odor when bruised.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"Sassafras\" src=\"/uploads/articles/original-496.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption>© sicloot, some rights reserved (CC-BY-NC-SA)</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Clusters of Small yellow flowers appear in early spring, a cycle which only starts after 10 years of age.

Both roots and bark were also once used medicinally as a tonic but seldom currently. Its unique appearance and flexibility make sassafras a good choice for the landscape. This includes the ability to adapt to different soil types and light conditions. The tree has some tolerance to drought and salt but is intolerant of urban pollution.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"small-text\">\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Arbor Day Foundation. (n.d.). Sassafras.

The branches can also form roots when in contact with the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"Silky Dogwood\" src=\"/uploads/articles/Cornus_amomum_02-508.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cornus_amomum_02.jpg\">Michael Wolf</a>, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0\">CC BY-SA 3.0</a>, via Wikimedia Commons</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>leaves are elliptical to ovate with smooth wavy margins and arcuate venation (distinctive of dogwoods) and burgundy fall colour. Twig and leaf undersides have silky hairs, hence the common name \'silky\'. The bark is smooth on young trees, bright red in colder times of the year, and reddish brown in the summer. The pith is brown on current years growth which is a distinguishing factor from red osier dogwood (having a white twig pith). Mature bark is brown, turning gray with age and gaining shallow fissures.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"Silky Dogwood\" src=\"/uploads/articles/Cornus_amomum_01-510.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<figcaption><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cornus_amomum_01.jpg\">Michael Wolf</a>, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0\">CC BY-SA 3.0</a>, via Wikimedia Commons</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Flat topped clusters of small whitish yellow flowers appear from May to June and attract butterflies and bees. From August to September, blue showy berry-like fruit (drupes) follow which is another distinguishing factor from red osier dogwood (having whitish fruit). Mammals such as turkeys, bears, chipmunks, foxes, and deer enjoy the fruit. They\'re also especially favorited by birds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Silky dogwood tolerates near full shade and a variety of soil conditions. It can serve as erosion control for borders and river banks. Some pest and disease issues may occur, but generally without serious problems. The shrub is subtly pleasant but not incredibly tidy or showy as a centerpiece; a good choice for woodland, naturalized plantings, waters edge, borders, and windbreaks.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"small-text\">\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Missouri Botanical Garden.

Sibbaldiopsis tridentata was formerly called Potentilla tridentata, but genetic analysis has placed it in its own genus. It inhabits sunny, dry, gravelly sites in mountains, uplands, and summits with an acidic ph. The leaves and stems are herbaceous and only the very the base and roots are woody. Three-toothed Cinquefoil has a prostrate form, spreading along rock crevices and the ground. Good as a groundcover for pollinator or rock gardens; it also will do well as a container plant that spills over the edge.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"Three Toothed Cinquefoil\" src=\"/uploads/articles/Potentilla_tridentata_4_5097353855-523.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Potentilla_tridentata_4_(5097353855).jpg\">Superior National Forest</a>, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0\">CC BY 2.0</a>, via Wikimedia Commons</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>leaves are compound and trifoliate, oblong lanceolate, with three teeth at the tip; glossy and evergreen, turning deep red in the fall if exposed to full sun. Most leaves are condensed at the base of the plant, Blooms occur from June to August with small, white, 5 petaled flowers resembling those of the \'Potentilla\'. Flowers eventually fold into seed pods which turn from green to grayish brown and form tiny hairy seeds inside. These attract pollinators and specialized bees.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"small-text\">\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>iNaturalist.ca. (n.d.). Three-toothed Cinquefoil Sibbaldiopsis tridentata.

It can be found in lowlands, stream banks, fence rows, and other moist areas. The genus \'Klematis\' is an old Greek word meaning \'climbing\'. The vine is vigorous and spreading by either suckers or self seeding. An ideal choice for native woodland or pollinator gardens. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Virgin\'s bower produces and abundant display of flowers on current years growth. Even in heavy shade many flowers are produced which is an uncommon trait for flowering plants. Leaves are bright green, compound with 3 to 5 elliptic, sharply toothed leaflets. Leaf petioles are tendrilous, allowing them to climb if given support. Stems are green to purplish and hairy, becoming woody with age.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Showy, sweetly aromatic white flowers appear in late summer through fall (August to October), attracting bees, wasps, moths, butterflies, and hummingbirds. Virgin\'s bower is Dioecious, meaning each plant is either male of female. Clusters of interesting seeds appear on female plants. Their hairy tails resembling an \'old man\'s beard\' hence one of its common names. Male plants flower abundantly but lack the seed display of female plants.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"virgins bower flowers\" src=\"/uploads/articles/Clematis_virginiana-290.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Clematis_virginiana_(1).jpg\">Malcolm Manners from Lakeland FL, USA</a>, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0\">CC BY 2.0</a>, via Wikimedia Commons</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Stems and roots of the plant have been used medicinally by native peoples.

It can be a ground cover or reach up to 50 feet in height when climbing up trees or buildings. At these heights, its woody stems can become several inches thick. The vine Thrives in sun and moisture but is very tolerant of shade as well as drier conditions. It inhabits a variety of locations from woods, valleys, and ravines to rocky bluffs, and hillsides.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"Virginia Creeper\" src=\"/uploads/articles/large-535.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<figcaption>© Chuck Thomas, some rights reserved (CC-BY-NC)</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Virginia creeper climbs using tendrils with sucker disks at their ends and arial roots which are Bright orange-brown in colour. The leaves are palmately compound with 5 leaflets; shinny above and paler underneath with serrated margins. The vine is often confused with poison ivy which has 3 leaflets. Greenish White flowers appear in late spring to early summer, but are hidden and insignificant. Vibrant dark blue fruit compliment the red to purple or crimson leaf colour in the fall. The very best fall leaf colour occurs when planted in sunny locations.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"Virginia Creeper\" src=\"/uploads/articles/1024px-Parthenocissus_quinquefolia_kz01-534.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Parthenocissus_quinquefolia_kz01.jpg\">Krzysztof Ziarnek, Kenraiz</a>, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0\">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>, via Wikimedia Commons</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Virginia creeper provides habitat and shelter for numerous birds, toads and insects. It also attracts bees and other insects with its pollen. The fruit provides food for birds, skunks, chipmunks, and other animals, but is highly poisonous to humans and may be fatal if ingested. The plant has, however, been used medicinally to treat headaches, jaundice, bunions, rheumatism, respiratory problems, and rashes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of planting, Virginia creeper is well suited as a climbing vine for fences or vertical gardens. Its toleration of pollution, salt, and a variety of conditions make the vine a good choice for urban or naturalized plantings. Care should be taken to ensure the vine has adequate room to spread or receives regular pruning to control growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"small-text\">\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Canadian Wildlife Federation.

The two types I see natively here in the Pacific North West are creeping juniper (Juniperus horizontalis), and common Juniper (Juniperus communis), but there are dozen of types that occur on most continents. Junipers are commonly found in dry areas, on rocky slopes, or forest edge under full sun to part shade. They can be identified by their scale-like leaves and branches; as small trees or low spreading shrubs. The leaf scales connect together in tight-fitting plates, whorls of needles, or a combination of the two. But perhaps their most notable feature is the ever changing frosted green berries they bare, ripening to dark blue over a one to three year period. Infact they aren\'t berries at all, but berry lookalikes; modified cones. This makes sense since Junipers are coniferous evergreen plants.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@naturewithus_/video/7322149933425888518\" data-video-id=\"7322149933425888518\" style=\"max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;\" > <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@naturewithus_\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@naturewithus_?refer=embed\">@naturewithus_</a> Juniper is amazing medicine <a title=\"naturalmedicine\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/naturalmedicine?refer=embed\">#naturalmedicine</a> <a title=\"juniperberries\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/juniperberries?refer=embed\">#juniperberries</a> <a title=\"naturalcoldremedy\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/naturalcoldremedy?refer=embed\">#naturalcoldremedy</a> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"?

Close Your Eyes Soothing Soft Music for Deep Sleep, Meditation, Relaxation and Yoga - Soothing Relaxation</a> </section> </blockquote> <script async src=\"https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js\"></script>\r\n\r\n<p>Juniper berries have been used for food and medicine in North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia for centuries. A juniper recipe for parasites was even found in ancient Egypt. It\'s no surprise these \'berries\' have been used so extensively. The dark blue capsule shaped cones are just packed with nutritional and medicinal benefits. Juniper has a warming effect on the body working against the feeling of being cold and problems associated with it. Each berry contains a combination of various flavonoids, cumarin (compounds with protective qualities), and volatile oils. Monoterpenes within have anticancer, antioxidant, and antibacterial properies. Powerful antioxidants can reduce cellular damage by protecting the body from free radicals.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Juniper berries\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230926_171819464-323.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Preparations</h3>\r\n<p>Juniper needles or berries can be prepared in many ways for medicinal use. It\'s no necessary but many prefer to crush or powder the berries to release their essential oils prior to using. Some ways to use it include a:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>tea</li>\r\n <li>infusion</li>\r\n <li>tincture</li>\r\n <li>salve</li>\r\n <li>essential oil</li>\r\n <li>oil</li>\r\n <li>bath</li>\r\n <li>cream</li>\r\n <li>poultice</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Stomach and Bladder</h3>\r\n<p>Use Juniper berries as a tea for urinary tract problems by increasing urine flow (diuretic). This helps clear the kidneys, bladder, gallbladder, and prostate; helps with heartburn and can be used to calm an upset stomach. Juniper activates the digestive system and stimulates digestive processes. For those with excess gas or in situations with gas producing foods, juniper can help minimize flatulence. In the intenstines, the antiseptic properties prevent and treat infection, and can be used to expel intestinal worms.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Topical Use</h3>\r\n<p>Externally, juniper is wonderful for muscles and joints as an oil massage for pain caused but sciatica or rheumatism. A poultice, salve, or oil would work well to target those problematic connective tissues. Juniper is also great for issues on the skin surface to clear up acne, help with dandruff, and to disinfect. For skin conditions one could prepare a juniper berry cream, bath, or oil. It\'s also safer to use externally rather than internally if used extensively, or for long periods.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Relaxation and Sleep</h3>\r\n<p>Juniper promotes a relaxing effect on the body and does very well as an essential oil. Use in a diffuser to purify the air while adding a fresh pine-like aroma. Helps with anxiety; juniper oil invokes relaxation and stress relief; it aids in a restful sleep for those having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. Simply diffuse into the bedroom air prior to bedtime. burning it like an incense, the smoke will disinfect the air in similar manner, and this was practiced by First Nations peoples. Juniper \'s purifying ability goes in hand with its spiritual use as protection as well as in warding off enemies and evil spirits. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Other Actions</h3>\r\n<p>Juniper berries and needles contribute to overall wellbeing and can be used as a tonic for immune system health. The plant has a warm and protective action. A good way to strengthen your body\'s defenses is using juniper tea in cold or flu season. It\'s also as a blood cleansing tonic for overall health by increasing the kidneys action of flushing out toxins from the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Juniper needles\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230708_000829786-325.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Nutrition & Food</h3>\r\n<p>Crushes or ground dried berries are excellent for flavouring marinates, meats, soups and Stews. Adds a sharp, pronounced taste and can be used similar to how pepper would. Infact, Adding dried berries to a pepper mill is a great way to flavor meals. Especially good with fish, crushed juniper berries do well to give fish the kick it needs. The needles and berries are also commonly used to smoke fish. Juniper is just packed with vitamins and minerals including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>vitamins A and C</li>\r\n <li>iron</li>\r\n <li>magnesium</li>\r\n <li>potassium</li>\r\n <li>phosphorus</li>\r\n <li>protein</li>\r\n <li>solium</li>\r\n <li>manganese</li>\r\n <li>niacin</li>\r\n <li>tin</li>\r\n <li>thiamine</li>\r\n <li>cobalt</li>\r\n <li>riboflavin</li>\r\n <li>chromium</li>\r\n <li>selenium</li>\r\n <li>silicon</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The native American Navajo would often mix ash from burned juniper with other ingredients when preparing traditional meals. Juniper ash contains a lot of calcium, a key dietary component since most of them don\'t raise cattle and are lactose intolerant. It turns out the body absorbs this ash calcium easier than that of milk. </p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Juniper colony\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230926_162303117-324.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Precautions</h3>\r\n<p>Long list of benefits right? Juniper is truly a powerfully healing plant with seemingly endless benefits. Of course with great power comes great responsibility and there are a few precautions to consider. Be sure to properly identify your juniper first. Many look very similar so think about your location and what grows in your region. The berries from savin juniper (Juniperus sabina) and prickly juniper (Juniperus oxycedrus) are poisonous. Careful with landscape plants, many popular cultivars are not native, savin juniper is a popular one. Avoid prolonged use of juniper and don\'t use if pregnant (the warming effect can cause miscarriages). since Juniper can irritate the liver, don\'t take it if you have liver disease. Juniper does well to combine with a demulcent such as plantain or coltsfoot. These naturally calm down irritation. The sharp taste of juniper berries hint of their power and being at best in moderation. One would seldom want to consume large amounts anyway just like how eating tablespoons of black pepper wouldn\'t be wise. I hope you are as excited as I am about this age old truely amazing plant, food, and medicine. I hope you use it with wisdom, care, and thanksgiving.</p>', '[{\"id\":\"322\",\"name\":\"PXL_20230926_162228720-322.jpg\",\"tag\":\"1\",\"description\":\"Juniper berry medicine\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"featured\"},{\"id\":\"323\",\"name\":\"PXL_20230926_171819464-323.jpg\",\"tag\":\"1\",\"description\":\"Juniper berries\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"featured\"},{\"id\":\"324\",\"name\":\"PXL_20230926_162303117-324.jpg\",\"tag\":\"1\",\"description\":\"Juniper colony\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"featured\"},{\"id\":\"325\",\"name\":\"PXL_20230708_000829786-325.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Juniper needles\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"}]', 2, '2024-01-07', NULL),

Numerous seeds are found within them. Many birds and wildlife eat the fruit and it can be eaten by humans as well. The berries can be prepared fresh, dried, as jams or jellies, but are not as palatable as other currants and gooseberries. A tea from the roots was used by native Americans to treat kidneys and remedy intestinal worms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>American black currant is the alternate host for white pine blister rust (along with other species of Ribes).

Though sometimes thought of as a common weed, it\'s actually one of the most well known and versatile of medicinal plants. Yarrow originates from the Dutch word yerw which is \"to repair\".

Legend also has it Achilles\'s mother brewed a giant vat of yarrow tea, picked him up by his heel and dipped him in it to give him invincible protection from his enemies. Since his heel was the only part that missed submersion, he was later hit by an arrow in the \"Achilles heel\", and was defeated. Further back in history, yarrow was even found in the tombs of early man, the Neanderthal primate, a 60,000 year old find.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"Yarrow leaves\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230821_220658983-329.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<h3>Identification</h3>\r\n<p>Yarrow is in the Aster family, one of the largest angiosperm families consisting of a large array of wildflowers, cultivated, and medicinal plants. Commonly found on roadsides, slopes, clearings, fields, and other dry, sunny, and mildly disturbed areas, the pant can spread and grow in groups or as solitary stemmed flowers. Flat clusters (corymb in form) of white to pinkish, fully pink, or pale purple flowers bloom from June to September depending on climate. Leaves are finely dissected and feather-like, hence the name millefolium, meaning \"a thousand leaves\". You can identify yarrow by the pungent smell let off by crushing its leaves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All parts of the yarrow plant can be used for medicine including flowers, stems, roots, and leaves. Yarrow is best used fresh but is often dried and ground to a powder for first aid kits or medicine cabinets. Medicinal preparations include a: tea, tincture, oil, poultice, steamed vapor, vinegar, hydrosol, bath, cream, among other applications. The plant keeps well dried or as a powder for years and still remains effective. Use wild, pure, or native yarrow where possible as cultivated varieties are known to be less medicinal.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"Yarrow flowers\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230821_144152389-330.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<h3>Wounds</h3>\r\n<p>Yarrow has a clotting action, giving it the ability to stop bleeding immediately. The astringent properties of yarrow causes skin to contract upon contact, helping to close wounds; it can stop the internal bleeding of exposed wounds by simply chewing up some leaves or flowers and applying it to a cut (spit poultice). This is a quick remedy for scrapes while hiking. Stuffing leaves in one\'s nose can stop nose bleeds, it can even be used on your animal\'s cuts and scrapes. Yarrow is a strong analgesic, relieving pain which often comes alongside with trauma and injury. Anti-septic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-bacterial abilities of yarrow aid in prevention and treatment of infection. The yarrow \"band aid\" used for wounds effectively stops bleeding, helps close the skin, assists with pain, and helps prevent infection all at the same time. Other skin related issues yarrow is used for include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>wasp stings</li>\r\n <li>insect and snake bites</li>\r\n <li>eczema and other skin conditions</li>\r\n <li>burns</li>\r\n <li>blisters, wounds</li>\r\n <li>hemorrhoids</li>\r\n <li>Measles</li>\r\n <li>chickenpox</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"Yarrow leaves\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230614_175047889-327.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Tooth aches are another sub-surface area that can be quite debilitating and hard to remedy. Chewing fresh yarrow root has a numbing effect and can give relief to tooth aches for up to 8 hours. Simply and hold a ball of chewed root in your mouth over the affected area.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cold and Flu</h3>\r\n<p>Yarrow teas, infusions, oils, and syrups are great for providing relief during flu season. Root infusions can be used to treat colds and battle the flu by inducing sweat (diaphoretic) needed for eliminate toxins in the body, and to help flush out fevers. Essential oils made from yarrow can be applied as a chest rub to remove congestion and sinuses when sick or with respiratory problems. Gargle with a yarrow decoction to releive sore throat, or use as a syrup for ongoing cough. Yarrow can have a warming effect if the body if experiencing coldness and can help provide warmth to the extremities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Circulatory System</h3>\r\n<p>Yarrow may be useful for those with circulatory problems. It can help with spider and varicose veins, to reduce symptoms when applied to the skin as a salve or oil. Yarrow stimulates circulation, assist with blood flow, and increases the strength of vein walls. Some of yarrow\'s volatile oils also stimulate blood flow to the skin surface.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"Yarrow leaves\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230629_200402960-328.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<h3>Female Issues</h3>\r\n<p>Yarrow is great as a woman\'s herb and for the many trials that come with womanhood. Yarrow tea is often used to ease suffering onset by menapause; The liver cleansing action promotes proper processing of estrogen and other hormones. It relaxes smooth muscles in the uterus and helps to normalize menstruation (emmenagogue). A decoction can be taken to reduce bleeding for those with heavy menstruation or for menstrual cramping pain. It also helps clear issues of premenstrual water retention. After birthing a child, a yarrow sitz bath can be used to help heal postpartum tearing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Stomach Issues</h3>\r\n<p>Use yarrow as an aromatic bitter to aid with mild indigestion, nausea, bloating, and digestive issues. Simply take a few drops of tincture before meals to stimulate digestive processes. Taking hydrosol from the distillation of yarrow is great way to increase bile and aid in digestion of fatty foods. The plant also removes inflammation in the digestive tract, and relaxes muscles in the intestines. On the way out, yarrow even helps with urinary issues, and works to clear bladder infections.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Food Use</h3>\r\n<p>The above ground parts of yarrow can be used as food but it\'s strongly, bitter, and astringent. It\'s best used more as a spice, the flavor of yarrow leaves resembles that of anise. A seasoned vinegar can be made from the leaves and flowers. This makes a great highly nutritious salad dressing, marinade, or topping. Yarrow has a history in flavoring bitters and liquors. Traditionally, the plant was brewed into a beer which oddly had mind altering effects when consumed.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"yarrow flowers\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230614_175020812.MP-331.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<h3>Other Uses</h3>\r\n<p>Without extending beyond the scope of this article, here are a few other uses for yarrow. Crushed leaves can be made into a tea to work as a sleep aid. Simply take yarrow tea before bed, or use during the day to reduce anxiety. Leaves can be burned as a mosquito repellant, and flowers and leaves burned and inhaled for headache relief. Yarrow has been used for inflamed joints, arthritis, and even used to protect against radiation damage. All plant parts can be used in an infusion as a general tonic for overall wellbeing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Precautions</h3>\r\n<p>Yarrow has some lookalikes in the Apiaceae family, some of which are poisonous such as the infamous poison hemlock. Queen Anne\'s Lace can also look similar. Yarrow has leaves are of feathered texture, with a soft, wooly stem. Be certain of proper identification before attempting to harvest it from the wild and use it for food or medicine. Avoid taking yarrow during pregnancy. Also if you are allergic to other plants in the aster famliy, avoid using yarrow.</p>', '[{\"id\":\"326\",\"name\":\"PXL_20230629_200335778-326.jpg\",\"tag\":\"1\",\"description\":\"Yarrow flowers\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"featured\"},{\"id\":\"327\",\"name\":\"PXL_20230614_175047889-327.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Yarrow leaves\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"},{\"id\":\"328\",\"name\":\"PXL_20230629_200402960-328.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Yarrow leaves\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"},{\"id\":\"329\",\"name\":\"PXL_20230821_220658983-329.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Yarrow leaves\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"},{\"id\":\"330\",\"name\":\"PXL_20230821_144152389-330.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Yarrow flowers\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"},{\"id\":\"331\",\"name\":\"PXL_20230614_175020812.MP-331.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"yarrow flowers\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"}]', 2, '2024-01-17', NULL),
(244, 'preparing-to-grow-wild-plant-seeds', 'Preparing To Grow Wild Plant Seeds', '<p>Growing wild plants seed is one of the most fulfilling experiences one can have as a naturalist or native plant enthusiast. There\'s nothing more satisfying than looking at a tree or plant years later, knowing you planted it yourself and nurtured it to maturity. Other benefits of growing from seed include adding genetic diversity you your garden, favorable root development of seedlings, and most importantly, cost savings. But before planting, it\'s important to know a few things about growing from seed in order to get the best success rate. Native and northern plants often have built in mechanisms that prevent them from germinating unless they\'ve been exposed to certain conditions they would be exposed to in nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Goldenrod Seeds\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240913_023029161.MP-380.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Stratification</h3>\r\n<p>Having seeds pass through a cold weather dormancy period is a process is called stratifying. Some plants such as grasses don\'t require it, but many others do. This dormancy period can range from a couple weeks to a few months, and it needs to simulate a winter so seeds know they\'ve endured the cold and need to \"wake up\" when it\'s over. It\'s probably the most important step in seed preparation, and for plants that require it, it can mean the difference between seeds sprouting or not coming up at all. Most seeds that need stratification require \"cold moist stratification\". Sowing seeds outdoors in the fall to grow in the spring is the simplest way to give them cold moist stratification naturally. But If you don\'t plan to direct sow, or need to have control of your timing, stratifying will have to be simulated with these steps:</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Cold moist stratification</h4>\r\n<ol>\r\n\r\n <li>thoroughly mix seeds with sterile perlite, vermiculite, or potting soil in a ratio of about 50% seed to 50% medium. Perlite works well because it\'s usually more sterile than soil and you can see the seeds better.</li>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Stratifying seeds in perlite\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240801_235923238.TS_exported_0~2-381.jpg\" />\r\n \r\n <li>put the mixture in a ziplock bag and add just enough water to make it moist but not waterlogged. Make sure the water is evenly distributed into the mixture</li>\r\n\r\n <li>Seal and label the bag with the seed name, date it was packaged, and any other information useful to you. Store them in the fridge and check on them every now and then. Give them more water if you notice the mixture is drying out and add more medium if too wet. Watch for signs of sprouting seeds, sometimes they\'ll germinate right in the fridge. Also Watch out for signs of mold which could happen if there is too much moisture or the medium you use is contaminated. Adding more medium, and spraying it with a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution can help mitigate the issue.</li>\r\n \r\n<li>When finished, plant them immediately. The amount of time seeds need to be kept in the fridge varies between species, some need only a couple of weeks and some need up to 4 months. We find most seeds should have about 3 months in the fridge for good results, but the specific amount of time should be available in the planting instructions for your given species.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>Warm Moist Stratification</h3>\r\n<p>Some seeds need soil exposure in the warm season before they experience the cold of winter and come up the following spring (unless they have a two year germination cycle). Warm moist stratification involves the same steps as cold moist stratification mentioned above, the only difference being the sealed bag should be left at room temperature for the required time. Simply store the seed-medium mixture in a sealed ziplock bag indoor on a shelf, pantry, or anywhere that stays at room temperature. Most seeds that need warm moist stratification, also need cold moist stratification to follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Strafiying seeds\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20231124_221957562.TS_exported_0-379.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Scarification</h3>\r\n<p>Seeds that need scarification often have a thick seed coat as a protection for what their preferred adventure will be in nature. Scarification happens naturally in the wild or it can be simulated. The process involves breaking down the seed coat in some way, by softening it, scratching it, heating it, etc. In nature, some seeds are surrounded by fruit and prefer to be passed through the digestive system of a bird or mammal. The stomach acids weaken their seed coat preparing them to pass through into a nice fertile stool on the ground. A great deal isn\'t it? Some tree cones need to be exposed to fire (such as a forest fire) before they release their seeds. Some like to be soaked in water (like after a heavy rain). Below are some methods used to soften or thin the seed coats of some that benefit from scarifying:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n <li><h4>Soaking</h4>\r\n<p>You can soak some seeds for 2 to 24 hours. This helps to penetrate the seed coat and allows it to take in water, often puffing it up and leaching away germination inhibitors.</p></li>\r\n<li><h4>Boiling water</h4>\r\n<p>Pour boiling water over the seeds. Yes! It sounds shocking but they\'ll be just fine. Use this method for legume family seeds and those with thick coats. Often followed by a 24hour soak.</p></li>\r\n<li><h4>Abrasion</h4>\r\n<p>Scratch or sand down the surface of your seeds by using a file or sand paper, just barely exposing the tender layer underneath. This allows water to reach the insides more easily for water absorption to take place (imbibition). You can also combine the seeds with sand in a jar and shake it or use a tumbler.</p></li>\r\n<li><h4>Acid</h4>\r\n<p>Using hydrogen peroxide or sulphuric acid on seeds simulates the stomach acids animals use to break down seed coats when they ingest fruit and berries. A 3% hydrogen peroxide to water solution is typically used as a soak for fruit seed in particular. It usually takes about 2 to 24 hours, careful not to soak them for too long! When done, be sure to rinse them thoroughly with water.</p></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Once seeds are scarified it\'s important to either plant them or stratify them (see above). Because their membranes have been exposed they need moisture to either start growing or go dormant. Not all seeds need to be scarified and often it\'s optional. Usually small, or wildflower seeds do just fine without any scarification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seed preparation sounds more complicated than it really is once you try it yourself. Just get to know the species your trying to grow and simulate how it would reproduce in the wild. Every situation is slightly different, depending on your climate, what growing medium you have available, etc. Fortunately there are growing instructions that can be followed so you don\'t have to do do too much experimentation.</p>', '[{\"id\":\"379\",\"name\":\"PXL_20231124_221957562.TS_exported_0-379.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Strafiying seeds\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"},{\"id\":\"380\",\"name\":\"PXL_20240913_023029161.MP-380.jpg\",\"tag\":\"1\",\"description\":\"Goldenrod Seeds\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"featured\"},{\"id\":\"381\",\"name\":\"PXL_20240801_235923238.TS_exported_0~2-381.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Stratifying seeds in perlite\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"}]', 2, '2024-02-05', NULL),
(245, 'planting-mail-order-seedlings', 'Planting Mail Order Seedlings', '<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"mail order seedlings\" src=\"/uploads/articles/mail-order-seedlings-333.jpg\" /></div>\r\n<p>Getting plant starters via mail is increasingly popular and a great way to find particular plants without having to do any travelling or shopping around (though shopping for plants can be fun too!). Plants can be surprisingly resilient in the mail, but by the time they arrive they\'ve probably endured days of darkness, possibly heat or cold and a lack fresh air. Proper care upon arrival is crucial to the survival our your precious investments.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Upon Arrival</h3>\r\n<p>Once your plants arrive, they should be taken out of their box immediately. Since many different types of plants often need to ship in the same box, some may have been cut back to fit and to avoid dehydration during delivery. Don\'t worry, there\'s no harm in it and they grow right back once settled in their new environment. The seedlings will likely need Watering right away. Soak the entire root system but make sure to let the water drain away. Immediate planting is ideal, but if not possible they may be kept in their pot, or root wrapped (if they\'re in a plug or soil block) for a few days provided they have air circulation, watering, and proper sun exposure according to your species. Remember they\'ve been in darkness for a long time so light exposure is also important.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Planting</h3>\r\n<p>First make sure your planting site has the right sun, soil type, and moisture levels for your species. If possible, aerate the planting area with a garden fork or shovel by prying it rather than turning it. This will break up the compaction. You may add some organic soil amendments if needed, just make sure to mix them with the native soil you\'re planting into. Dig a hole at least twice the diameter and to equal depth of the root ball. Gently remove plants from trays if applicable by squeezing or pushing the tray bottom and holding the plant from the very base of its stem. Plants that ship in a seedling tray should have their roots scored before planting. This involves using a knife and cutting across any circling or dense root clusters, breaking their spiral action. This helps the roots to grow outward once planted. If your seedling comes in a soil block, they won\'t need this step since their roots were air pruned as they grew. Plant your seedling to equal ground depth of the existing root ball and lightly pack the soil around it. Make a slight mound around your seedling to help retain water while establishing. Give it a good watering, enough for the very bottom roots to receive it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Maintenance</h3>\r\n<p> Applying a mulch of some kind is great for retaining moisture, improving soil biology, and to help with weed control. This could be wood chips, leaves, grass clippings, or even newspaper works. Newly planted seedlings often have a higher success rate when mulch is used. Water and weeding as needed for the first couple seasons, and reapply mulch annually. 1 to 3 inches of mulch does wonders, just make sure not to mound much around plant stems. Doing so could cause rotting around the base of the stem. Once your plants are established (especially for native plants and perennials) they shouldn\'t need much besides mulch and maybe not even that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seeds are great for certain plants like wildflowers and can be a great choice, especially when on a budget. But growing from seed can sometimes be a bit tricky, all depending. Mail order seedlings may be the next best economical choice and the success rate is much higher when planting something that already has roots. Shopping around for plants in person is a fun experience, don\'t get me wrong, but if you need to go native or want something particular, mail order plants are a great way to go. I tried it myself years ago and was so excited to get my native plants in the mail! They arrived in great condition, were planted and grew just fine. What a great idea! we hope to give the same experience to our customers.</p>', '[{\"id\":\"333\",\"name\":\"mail-order-seedlings-333.jpg\",\"tag\":\"1\",\"description\":\"mail order seedlings\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"featured\"}]', 2, '2024-02-07', NULL);

As of 2016, 11,190 hectares of this unique plot of land was dedicated as provincial park for preservation and our enjoyment. This is raw nature at its best. Ancient Forest is bursting at the seams with biodiversity including ferns, devil\'s club, rare or thought to be extict plants, and most importantly, the giant western red cedar of the Cypress family (Thuja plicata) or \"Tree of Life\".</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"Western Red Ceder Roots\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240817_210924522.MP-346.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Only Inland Temperate Rainforest</h3>\r\n<p>These trees are way bigger than anything else in Northern BC. Nothing close to this size is expected to grow so far up north and away from the ocean. Normally found near costal regions of the Pacific north west, only a strip eastern inland BC down to Idaho and Montana harbors this maritime like climate. Why? Pacific air rising over the nearby Columbia Mountains creates favorable rainfall and milder temperatures. Plentiful snow melt in the spring and precipitation during the otherwise drier months supports old growth forests similar to that of the coast. This makes Ancient Forest the only inland temperate rainforest in the world. </p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Ancient Forest Devils Club\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240817_203334950-339.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Living Ancient Wonders</h3>\r\n<p>Being in the presence of these mythical beings \r\nreminds me of a scene from Star Wars. As you approach, they gradually reveal themselves from the fog. Sweeping root flares rise collectively into massive knarled sometimes hollow stems. The tops sometimes die off and U-shaped branches curve upward toward their ends. These may thicken and becoming leaders, extending the life of the tree. An example of this concept is \"Tree Beard\", one of the largest and most interesting-shaped cedars of Ancient Forest. It stands at the climactic point on the main trail, with a station informing visitors of its significance.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"Western Red Cedar Up Close\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240817_210552875-335.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>We don\'t have trees like this out east. Having moved from Niagara (Ontario), I noticed the western red cedar is strikingly similar to its siblings, the eastern white cedar. Both have hanging canopies of scale-like leaves and long strands of fibrous bark. It was comforting and exciting at the same time imagining as if these trees made their way to the other side of the continent and became giants! Of course the reality of which came first, I\'m not sure of.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A Shelter For Life</h3>\r\n<p>The canopies of western red cedar trees are home for a diverse variety of birds, bats, and other mammals. Bears often den in the hollows, and large platforms or cavities in the branches create ecosystems of lichens, and bryophytes. These decay over time, creating soil for plants like sword fern and salal to grow. Even hemlock and alder trees will take root in these high fertile platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><figure>\r\n<img alt=\"Sword Fern\" src=\"/uploads/articles/original-342.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption>© Connor E.

Smaller animals like red squirrels, voles, and snowshoe hares can girdle the base of young trees. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Western red cedar is an important food source for birds and mammals, it grows slowly and struggles to re-establish from animal damage. This can be a problem when accompanied by logging, global warming, and the increase of forest fires.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\r\n\r\n<h3>Trees Built To Last</h3>\r\n<p>The age and size of these trees are impressive.\r\nWestern red cedars have been present in western North America for about 50 million years. Some of the oldest specimens today are upwards of 2000 years, growing to 230 feet tall, and to 23 ft in diameter. That\'s about 6 and a half school busses stacked end to end in height! These along with the coast redwood and giant sequoia are among the largest trees in the world. The \"Cheewhat Giant\" on Vancouver Island measures to 450 cubic meters, making it the largest tree in Canada by volume and the largest red cedar in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"float-left\" alt=\"western red cedar leaves\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240717_214635242.MP-345.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<p>How do these trees achieve such grandeur in size and age? Besides unknown reasons only the creator must know, much can be attributed to biological advantages as well as environmental ones which give western red cedar the gift of age. They can tolerate a variety of soil types ranging from nutrient rich to poor soils. In depleted areas they can be found in all stages, from pioneer to mid succesion but are often among the final specimens of the most mature, biologically rich old growth forests. In more temperate coastal areas the tree grows abundantly in many soil types . If inland, it prefers in moisture rich areas like Ancient Forest, fed by mountain water, streams, or areas with plenty of rainfall or stagnant water. Newly formed saplings are very tolerant of shade while growing in the understory of Douglas fir, western hemlock, and stika spruce. This can last many years before they rise to dominate the sun covered forest peak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike many other conifers, western red cedar has good ability to regenerate vegetatively. the branches and stems of these cedars take root easily, sending down roots when branches touch the ground; even fallen logs can regenerate and shoot up new leaders. Nurseries that propagate Cedars take advantage this vegetative reproduction. It\'s common to start new trees from cuttings (rather than seed) since they root so easily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Western red cedars are truely durable trees, tolerating many soils, low light, and low soil nutrition. They can even survive forest fires, only to recover and regenerate themselves but they do need lots of access to water and aren\'t tolerant of dry areas. Perhaps this preference helps the tree always have an adement water supply throughout its life. Rot resistance (which I mention later) is a big factor as well to the preservation of bark and wood in its high moisture habitat.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>A Sacred Tree</h3>\r\n<p>For thousands of years, First Nations used western red cedar extensively for tools, baskets, homes, totem poles, and canoes to name a few. The bark of western red cedar has both flexibility and strength properties. It was used to make things like rope and fishing line; the vines even had sufficient strength to haul in whales. Soft inner bark could be woven and used as such in daily necessities like clothing, bedding, and blankets. Heartwood was extracted from different live standing trees and they would use logs fallen from windstorms. This extra care taken preserved the tree helped grow the forest and provide for their ancestors.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Western Red Cedar Wood\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20241104_153539644.MP-347.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<p>Cedar trees were also good medicine. Leaves could be boiled and made into a tea, rich in calcium and vitamin C.\r\nWalking within the canopy is said to cleanse ones spirits and take away bad feelings. Native peoples used the branches extensively in ceremonies; Seen as \"the tree of life\" for healing and protection. Once small in population, the western red cedar owes the vast majority of it\'s current habitat to the native peoples who planted these sacred trees in their paths over thousands of years.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Modern Value</h3>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"float-right\" alt=\"Williams Lake Museum Cedar\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240927_181239896-344.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<p>Western red cedar wood is a highly valuable commercially, two to five times the cost of nearby logging woods. It splits easily, is strong yet flexible, and Has an attractive reddish appearance for architecture. A naturally produced fungicide called thujaplicin gives it rot resistance without the need to be stained or treated, which is probably its most valuable feature. This allows fallen logs to resist decay for over 100 years. Cedar is used extensively outdoors where this resistance is needed for shingles, fence posts, and decking. Along with an advantage over decay, the wood has good sound proofing, insulation abilities, and shrinks less than other conifers. This makes stripped trunks of western red cedar highly sought after for building log homes. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Future Is Uncertain</h3>\r\n<p>Western red cedars live in areas of natural resilience. Ancient Forest along with other old growth temperate rainforests resist fires, drought and flooding while sequestering more carbon than any above water area in the world. In Recent years however, global warming has impacted populations and is expected to continue if nothing changes.<br>\r\nThe Salish peoples have a story of the cedar man, who possess a gift of foretelling and preparing for the future. At the end of his life, the creator transformed him into this ever giving tree. Perhaps the spirit of this tree continues to foretell the future as it begins to decline, warning us of the stress of the earth, and if we don\'t change for the better, the western red cedar will perhaps no longer be able to give us of its endless abundance. For now, nature reserves like the must see Ancient Forest will help spread awareness, protect, and preserve this sacred tree for the enjoyment of our ancestors and those of Lheidli T’enneh for many years to come.</p>', '[{\"id\":\"335\",\"name\":\"PXL_20240817_210552875-335.jpg\",\"tag\":\"1\",\"description\":\"Western Red Cedar Up Close\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"featured\"},{\"id\":\"338\",\"name\":\"PXL_20240817_204706984-338.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Ancient Forest\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"},{\"id\":\"339\",\"name\":\"PXL_20240817_203334950-339.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Ancient Forest Devils Club\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"},{\"id\":\"342\",\"name\":\"original-342.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Sword Fern\",\"caption\":\"\\u00a9 Connor E.

The plant its self is a wildflower for your meadow. The yellow blossoms add colour and and the combination of leaves, sepals, and petals have an interesting look. Yellow rattle also adds diversity to the local ecosystem by attracting various birds, and pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If possible, let them grow a season or two, allowing them to weaken the grass before introducing other wildflowers in into your meadow. Yellow rattle will move its way through the field over the years. Note though taxonomical differences are still being sorted out, the subspecies \"groenlandica\" growing in alpine or subalpine regions in a variety of habitat across North America is considered native, while other subspecies are considered introduced. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using semi-parasitic plants such as yellow rattle is, in my opinion, the most natural, uninvasive way to turn large areas of grass into meadow. It\'s been proven over and over again in nature without the use of hands. The tradeoff is time, but for large, grassy areas, and especially where this plant grows naturally nearby; one can easily gather seed, mow, rake, and cast the seed to areas where meadow is planned to be. Over time it will clear the path for a more diverse variety of delicate-feeding meadow plants.</p>', '[{\"id\":\"348\",\"name\":\"PXL_20230810_184038399.MP-348.jpg\",\"tag\":\"1\",\"description\":\"yellow rattle flowers\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"featured\"},{\"id\":\"349\",\"name\":\"PXL_20230830_182944708-349.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"yellow rattle\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"},{\"id\":\"350\",\"name\":\"PXL_20240909_014957058-350.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Yellow Rattle Meadow\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"}]', 2, '2024-11-18', NULL),

It likes growing at altitude, often to the tree line in a variety of soils from rich to rocky or clay soils. It\'s an important symbol of the Canadian Rockies; uses for paper and pulp, and important for habitat and as a seed food source for small mammals. </p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eO7WJFmT8gM?si=3_2CjNySu58gJUmX\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>This article is about how to grow subalpine fir, but the same idea could apply to growing any fir tree from seed. This is the most effective way to start fir trees as they don\'t root easily from cuttings and they don\'t send up suckers from the ground for dividing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Collecting the Seeds</h3>\r\n<p>Start by collecting seeds from ripe cones. Fir trees have them standing straight up on-top of branches, high at the top of the tree where you can\'t see them. You can identify Subalpine fir by flexible needles with rounded ends that point upwards, with two bands of light stripes underneath.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"Subalpine Fir Needles\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20241101_185436178.MP-351.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The bark has a somewhat horizontal pattern of resin sacks (smooth raised bumps). Collecting the cones can be a challenge, but I find the easiest way is via squirrels. Try to find an area where subalpine spruce is plentiful. Squirrels like to feed on the seeds when they\'re ripe and can drop cones on the ground while doing so. I like to take forest walks in late summer to early fall while looking conifer cones squirrels have dropped. Ripe subalpine fir cones are dark purple to gray like the ones below, found in late August (Northern BC).</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"Subalpine Fir Cone\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240820_201752964-353.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike this of pine and spruce, fir cones normally fall apart into pieces, releasing it\'s seeds before hitting the ground, so cones need to be collected while they\'re just ripebut still intact. If you can\'t wait to find squirrel rashions, you can use a pole pruner, climbor cut down the tree if you have use for the wood and are able to do so. Just make sure to use some binoculars first to see if there\'s cones at the top and they\'re ripe enough.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Seed Treatment</h3>\r\n<p>Once collected, lay them out to dry by a sunny window or similar. The cone scales are held together by resin, once softened, the cone breaks apart. You may also be able to break it up by hand. This will release winged seeds within.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"Subalpine Fir Seeds\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240820_202118352.MP-354.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>the seeds are \"asleep\" at this point and will need to be exposed to the cold (stratified) to break dormancy. This will remove the growth inhibitors within the seeds and allow them to \"wake up\". \r\nTo do this, place the seeds in a bag of sterile medium at a ratio of about two times the amount of medium too seed. I like to use perlite because it\'s porous, allowing for air pockets, and you can see the seeds easily. Add just enough water to make it moist but but without puddled water at the bottom. Label, and store in the fridge. Keep them in the fridge for about a month. If seeds are collected from harsher climates, allow for two months.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Planting</h3>\r\n<p>The stratified seeds can then be planted in the ground in the spring but they\'ll have a better chance of success if grown in seed starting trays, soil blocks, or containers first.\r\nThe seeds don\'t need any nutrition to sprout so you can optionally start them in sand then transplant them to potting mix as soon as the first leaves appear. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subalpine fir is quite tolerant of different soils, but prefers it slightly acidic, ranging from about 5.5 to 6.5. A purchased potting mix should be fine as long as it falls within that range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If making your own potting medium, a mix of mostly peat moss or screened pine bark would be ideal. Pearlite, vermiculite, or sand can be added for drainage, and something like compost for nutrition. It would be good to test the ph of your mix since peat and pine bark may not always be as acidic as expected depending on the source. If too alkaline, elemental sulphur may need to be added and ericaceous compost can be used instead for nutrition.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Transplanlanting</h3>\r\n<p>Seedlings can be transplanted to their final destination when about a foot high, or when vigorous enough to compete other plants and the elements. This is best done in either early spring or the fall, when the soil is cool and moist. Times of heat stress or canopy growth in late spring or summer are best avoided. In the wild, subalpine fir is a \"pioneer species\", as a fist or secondary tree to establishish barren ground ground, or hash areas where others can\'t yet grow. They should survive even when transplanted to relatively poor sites, just clear surrounding competing plants, loosen (aerate) the soil first, and add a bit of compost or other amendment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the spring I decided to try uprooting different conifer seedlings from the forest on my property and transplanting them to my field. The site was tough and mostly clay. I spent a little time clearing, loosening the area then planting Lodge pine, white spruce, and subalpine fir wild seedlings. Most of the roots were damaged from uprooting, and I didn\'t add any amendments, and just let them go un-maintained from the season. By fall, grass took over, all the lodgepole pine seedlings were dead, but the spruce and subalpine fir had the best success rate. \r\nBelow is a surviving subalpine spruce...</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Subalpine Fir In Grass\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20241109_205904296.MP-355.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<p>These trees have proven themselves in the wild, surviving almost anywhere and likewise aren\'t difficult or fussy to grow. The biggest challenge is probably collecting the seeds. We sometimes have them available for purchase <a href=\"https://naturewithus.com/plants/coniferous-trees/subalpine-fir\">here</a>. Either way, it takes a bit of time, but is well worth it. It\'s such a pleasure growing native trees from seed and I hope this article helps you in your endeavors, as always, try it yourself!</p>', '[{\"id\":\"351\",\"name\":\"PXL_20241101_185436178.MP-351.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Subalpine Fir Needles\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"},{\"id\":\"352\",\"name\":\"1000000504-352.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Subalpine Fir Needles\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"},{\"id\":\"353\",\"name\":\"PXL_20240820_201752964-353.jpg\",\"tag\":\"1\",\"description\":\"Subalpine Fir Cone\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"featured\"},{\"id\":\"354\",\"name\":\"PXL_20240820_202118352.MP-354.jpg\",\"tag\":\"1\",\"description\":\"Subalpine Fir Seeds\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"featured\"},{\"id\":\"355\",\"name\":\"PXL_20241109_205904296.MP-355.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Subalpine Fir In Grass\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"}]', 2, '2024-11-21', NULL),

There are different types depending on your location, but collecting seeds, and growing, and soil preference are all similar.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><figure>\r\n<img alt=\"Great Northern Aster Seedlings\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240810_213346685-360.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption>Great northern aster seedlings</figcaption>\r\n</figure></div>\r\n\r\n<p>You can start collecting seeds from the dry flower heads in the early fall. Where I am it\'s right about the time when cooler weather starts, early through late September. You can remove the fluff if you want by rubbing them through a sieve, or just take them as they are. If you missed your chance or don\'t have access to seeds, you can purchase them <a href=\"https://naturewithus.com/plants/herbaceous-plants/showy-aster\">here</a></p>.\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Showy Aster Seed Heads\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240916_164554545.MP-358.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<p>Since Asters grow in Northern climates, the seeds will need to be stratified, (this means to experience a period of cold weather before they can germinate). Do do this, you can either plant them directly outdoors in the fall, or place them in the fridge for about 2 months, in a ziplock bag with slightly moist sand or perlite. Then plant them outside in early spring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plant them right on the soil surface or just barely covered as the seeds will need light to germinate.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"Showy Aster Seeds in Soil\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20241126_212326476-361.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Asters generally prefer well drained, loam or sand soil with a slightly acidic ph. When I first tried growing them, the ph was way too high due to my mineral rich well water. I also added too much wood ash in the soil mix. This led to some major deficiencies in growth, leaf size and leaf colour. There are many soil mixes out there, but just think well drained, not too high ph, and not too nutrient rich.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second mistake I made when first growing Astors was over watering. Since they naturally grow on sunny slopes, they need drier, more well drained soil. When I stopped watering my asters so much they started to do better. These plants don\'t need to much water, fertilizer, and fuss; Infact they prefer it that way.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"Showy Aster Seedlings\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240810_213314436-357.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, they\'re easy and rewarding to grow.

In this article we will talk about gathering the seeds and growing them from start to finish.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D1_JpQLMbGo?si=tOAuWiYH1Dj1rehW\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<h3>Collecting the Berries</h3>\r\n<p>Berries can be collected in late summer (August, here in northern BC). They\'re not always the most obvious to detect, but easy enough once you become familiar with them and are actively looking. I\'ve seen them on gravelly slopes, along forest paths, in rich soils of understories, and in open areas of inner forests. Some indicator plants they often grow near are thimbleberry, bearberry, raspberry, juniper, various conifer trees, and underneath sands of lodgepole pine. These are places of more acidic soils where there\'s good drainage.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"Velvet Leaves Blueberry Berries\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240820_225037161-363.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<h3>Processing the Berries for Seed</h3>\r\n<p>Once collected, they\'ll need to be processed to remove the fruity flesh and get separate the seed inside. One method is to mix the berries with water and use a blender to juice them. This is the best way I know of if you need to get it done quickly, but while it does work there is chance of some of the berries being damaged in the blending process. The other good option is to ferment them first them macerate by hand. Simply put them in a ziplock bag with some water and let it sit for a couple of weeks. The berries will ferment and soften.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Fermented velvet leaf blueberries\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20241204_212607746-368.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<p>Mash them up then dilute the mixture with water. Viable seeds should sink to the bottom. Pour off the floating material and repeat until you\'re left with mostly seed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><div class=\"small-text\">\r\nNote: This is just an approximate rule, there may be some non viable seeds that sink and some viable ones that float, so it\'s good to start with a few extra berries!\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see, the seeds are tiny, all these seeds are from just 4 berries.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"velvet leaf blueberry seeds\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20241204_213300489-369.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<p>Pour off the water and allow the seeds to dry on a paper towel for 24 hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Stratifying</h3>\r\n<p>They\'ll need cold weather exposure to break their dormancy. This can be done by either planting them outdoors in a pot or tray in the fall, or by the bag method: mix the seeds with some sand or perlite and place in a ziplock bag. Moisten it a little with a bit of water (not too much), then refrigerate or place outside for at least 3 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Soil Preparation</h3> \r\n<p>I should note that blueberries need acidic soil to do well (between 3.8 and 5.5) and should have some organic matter. A soil mix of mostly Pete or sifted pine bark would due nicely. It would be good to do a PH test either way if making your own soil mix since Pete of different brands aren\'t always acidic enough. If that\'s the case you may need to amend it with elemental sulphur to lower the PH and it needs to be done months before you use it. You could for example use a mix of 40% pine bark, 30% Pete, 30% sand and add sulphur if needed. You can also optionally mix in a bit of compost, just make sure to test that it doesn\'t raise the PH too much since compost is usually around neutral.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Planting</h3>\r\n<p>Come early spring if you did the bag method, spread the mixture on a planting tray or pot (sand included) in part shade. Of course If you planted in the fall, they\'re already there. Planting depth should be just below the surface since the seeds are quite small. Keep them moist and no need to apply heat. They should come up in about 1.5 to 3 months. It will take some patience and Like many other native plants, they won\'t all come up at the same time. It can be a bit sporadic and once you think they\'re done another comes up! Watch for them; they start off quite small, the green to reddish leaves will appear, held by a zig-zaging stem. </p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Velvet Leaves Blueberry Seedlings\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240917_171306173.MP-366.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Transplanting</h3>\r\n<p>Once the seedlings are small but seem big enough to handle (have a few pairs of leaves) they\'re ready to transplant. Pluck them out with the assistance of a butter knife, being careful not to damage the roots too much. Transplant them into their own soil block, pot, or just space them out so they can grow without competition. Again, it will take patience as they grow slowly. This was all I got out of the first season of growth from these little guys and it will need three season before fruit can be produced.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"Velvet Leaves Blueberry Seedlings\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240810_213032927.MP-367.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Though it\'s possible to propagate them from cuttings I still find seed to be the best and most satisfying way for the majority of native plants I\'ve tried growing. Seedlings end up with better form, root development, biodiversity, and larger quantities than with cuttings or divisions. This article just covers one method that seemed to work for me.

It can be harvested all season long (all year round in warmer areas), but is best done in early spring when leaves are more tender. Use it fresh or soon after drying whether eating, tincturing, making a poultice, an infusion, etc. as the dried herb loses its effectiveness in about six months.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"dried shepherds purse\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230721_203932658-371.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Food Uses</h3>\r\n<p>Tender leaves and young shoots can be eaten raw, Later they become tough but can still be used to flavor broth. All plant parts have a peppery flavor, and the seeds and seed pods can even work as a pepper substitute. This explains the less common name for the plant as \"poor man\'s pepper\". In China, Korea, and Japan, shepherd\'s purse is used to season meats, rice, soups, and as an ingredient in dumpling filling. The plant is quite nutritious, high in omega3 as well as vitamins K, A, rutin, iron, niacin, thiamine, fumaric acid, inositol, and choline. It\'s also good for vitamin C, calcium, potassium, magnesium, and B2.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Hemorrhaging</h3>\r\n<p>Perhaps most notable and powerful medicinal use for shepherd\'s purse is to stop external or internal bleeding. Due to its extremely high vitamin K content it effectively treats wounds, and works to stop nosebleeds and heavy menstrual bleeding. It does this by improving the body\'s ability to clot blood.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@naturewithus_/video/7450621439754915078\" data-video-id=\"7450621439754915078\" style=\"max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;\" > <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@naturewithus_\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@naturewithus_?refer=embed\">@naturewithus_</a> Music: Alive Musician: @iksonmusic Medicinal Shepherd&#39;s Purse to clot the blood in postpartum hemorrhaging, and stop bleeding wounds. <a title=\"naturalmedicine\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/naturalmedicine?refer=embed\">#naturalmedicine</a> <a title=\"foraging\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foraging?refer=embed\">#foraging</a> <a title=\"postpartumrecovery\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/postpartumrecovery?refer=embed\">#postpartumrecovery</a> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"original sound - naturewithus_\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7450621443184085766?refer=embed\">original sound - naturewithus_</a> </section> </blockquote> <script async src=\"https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js\"></script></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Shepherd\'s purse if often thought of as a \"woman\'s herb\", assisting in the many struggles that come with owning a set of female reproductive organs! prolonged menstruation, causing over bleeding is a struggle for many, and shepherd\'s purse is a tried and tested aid for reducing to stopping over bleeding. It\'s also well known for use after child birth. During times of excessive postpartum hemorrhaging, this herb can be very helpful in contracting the uterus and helping with natural healing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Astringent properties contract skin cells and other body tissues, helping to close cuts; its anti microbial effect can also aid in disinfection. It\'s no surprise, German soldiers in WWI used shepherd\'s purse to dress their wounds. Use this herb externally as a poultice, or internally as a tea or tincture. Yarrow is used in the same way as shepherd\'s purse except it does so by constricting the blood vessels rather than clotting the blood. Yarrow and shepherd\'s purse can be used together for this purpose and combined are a good formula to control bleeding.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"yarrow and shepherd\'s purse\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230805_021406711-376.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<h3>Other Uses For Shepherd\'s Purse</h3>\r\n<p>Besides it\'s reputation as a blood clotter and woman\'s aid, shepherd\'s purse has quite a few other medicinal applications. This includes stopping inflammation externally and within the body; useful for the many and diverse side effects of inflammation like allergic reactions, arthritis, pain, swelling, and digestive upset. It\'s a mild diuretic, helping with urination, to flush and clean out the liver and bladder. It\'s also been said help to reduce bed wetting. Shepherds purse has been used to treat various stomach and digestive problems by stimulating digestion, improving appetite, and dealing with Indigestion and cramping. It helps in enzyme production to aid digestion, and its astringent properties can help with diarrhea.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Precautions</h3>\r\n<p>It is not advised to use shepherds purse during pregnancy and labour. It can potentially cause unwanted clotting of blood, contractions, or menstruation, resulting in potential miscarriage. Instead, it\'s best used after bleeding issues postpartum, after all labor is over. Avoid also if on blood thinners or if you have high blood pressure.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Growing Shepherd\'s Purse From Seed</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Shepherd\'s purse is very easy to grow without much effort and seed viability is exceptional (up to 35 years in the ground). It\'s currently grown commercially in China and can be found in some Asian supermarkets. As a cool weather crop, seeds can be sown in early fall or spring in full sun to part shade. Sow in disturbed soil and with light exposure so just sprinkle the seeds on the surface. Keep the soil moist while propagating as shepherd\'s purse prefers it, but once established it\'s drought resistant. </p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"growing shepherds purse from seed\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230721_162305095-370.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The recursive flowering of shepherd\'s purse attracts pollinators and in this way will also help support your fruit and vegetable garden. It\'s a vigorous grower and plants can produce multiple seed crops, only a small patch can quickly offer its self to forage and medicine all throughout the season!</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"shepherds purse flowers\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230829_220157850-374.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\nI hope this article finds you well and helps you on your quest for better health and wellbeing.

Its name hints of where it was found and commonly used (Atlantic Canada), but Labrador tea grows in many parts of the Northern Hemisphere and has a long history of therapeutic and medical use. This is especially true amongst first Nations people and Europeans who used it extensively as a tea. It\'s commonly found in acidic peatlands, bogs, conifer stands and other wet areas of the boreal forest. It can also sometimes be found on drier mountain slopes and rocky stream banks.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Labrador Tea Habitat\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240528_233021710.MP-385.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Identification</h3>\r\n<p>Identified by thick evergreen leaves with edges curled under and woolly rust-orange undersides; these radiate up the stem in a whored fashion. Spherical flower heads at the top of stems open into white flowers from late spring to early summer. The leaves and seed pods persist through winter and crushing them releases the fragrant essential oils within.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Labrador Tea Flowers\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240701_153602705-384.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<p><div class=\"small-text\">\r\nThere are a few species of Labrador Tea in North America besides the most well known Rhododendron groenlandicum. Western Labrador tea (Rhododendron columbianum) is found in western Canada and the United States. Rhododendron tomentosum grows closer to the Arctic and is dwarfed, with smaller and narrower leaves.\r\n</div></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Harvesting All Year</h3>\r\n<p>Gather the a leaves or twigs in early spring or fall to use right away or dry it for later, but the plant can be harvested year-round. Flowers can be picked in the summer when they bloom. Harvest leaves by taking a few from different plants so as not to destroy their slow growing heads. One of the best things about Labrador tea is because it\'s an evergreen it can be easily identified harvested in the winter. Leaves and seed pods poke out of the snow, fragrant and potent as ever to be used for food and medicine. I find winter months to often be when Labrador tea is needed the most. Cold and flu in particular run ramped in homes and dried herbs from the warm season may not always be available. Labrador tea just happens to be an excellent choice for such situations, and besides filling a cup of hot tea this herb has countless other uses and benefits that we\'ll touch on below. </p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Labrador Tea Seed Pods\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20241123_230001810.PORTRAIT-386.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Cold and Flu</h3>\r\n<p>As mentioned, Labrador tea is a go to herb for cold, flu, and all the challenging symptoms that come along the ride. It helps with issues of the upper respiratory tract, calms Irritating coughs, even helping with asthma. When brewing a tea, try inhaling the steam in addition to drinking it to help clear the sinuses. The herb helps also to clear up chills and headaches, promoting perspiration to relieve fever. For those with the stomach flu, it helps calm diarrhea and upset stomach. It\'s also well known to promote a good night sleep, another challenge with cold and flu. Labrador tea is definitely one of the first herbs I think of when sick. Actually at the time of writing this article it is now winter; I have a terrible cold and have been drinking some dried Labrador tea I gathered in the summer to clear my sinuses and help me sleep, no joke!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Pain</h3>\r\n<p>Labrador tea is an analgesic, good for different types of pain, especially caused by inflammation. It works to reduce pain internally as a tea or tincture, or externally as a poultice, oil, cream, wash, or ointment. For example, it can be applied as a poultice or an oil to help reduce muscle pain, arthritis, and inflammatory conditions like rheumatism. It has also been used in the mouth to sooth teething pains for infants.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Labrador Tea Blooming\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240701_153627136-383.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Skin Issues</h3>\r\n<p>The herb is good for all kinds of skin issues and deals with external inflammation as it does inside the body. This includes helping with burns, chapped skin, rashes, scabies, and itchiness. It can help relieve stings or bites from insects. The herb freshens skin by removing toxins; a hydrosol face wash can be made to help clear up blemishes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Head and Scalp</h3>\r\n<p>There are multiple benefits to using Labrador tea on the hair and scalp. Native peoples used it to reduce hair loss and it benefits the scalp by helping with dandruff. Washing hair with a decoction of Labrador tea a few times a day (and left on) is a way kill or weaken head lice, similar to how tea tree oil works.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@naturewithus_/video/7376402155315465478\" data-video-id=\"7376402155315465478\" style=\"max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;\" > <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@naturewithus_\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@naturewithus_?refer=embed\">@naturewithus_</a> Harvesting medicinal labrador tea <a title=\"herbalmedicine\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/herbalmedicine?refer=embed\">#herbalmedicine</a> <a title=\"cancer\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/cancer?refer=embed\">#cancer</a> <a title=\"naturalmedicine\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/naturalmedicine?refer=embed\">#naturalmedicine</a> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"soft background music with piano string bells(1283463) - earbrojp\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/soft-background-music-with-piano-string-bells-1283463-7133294036689651714?refer=embed\">soft background music with piano string bells(1283463) - earbrojp</a> </section> </blockquote> <script async src=\"https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js\"></script></div>\r\n\r\n<h3>Other Uses</h3>\r\n<p>There are numerous other powerful benefits to this plant, here\'s a brief summary. As a mild blood purifying tonic, Labrador tea can be taken for general health of the body to stimulate the lymph nodes, regenerate liver health, and help remove toxins. The plant has also been used to treat tumors. Studies have shown twigs help fight against colon cancer, lung cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia. Labrador tea has a calming effect to help for relaxation and to control anxiety and winter depression. As a women\'s medicine it can help with period issues and urine problems. Labrador tea is anti-microbial and an antibiotic against various bacteria and yeast. It\'s therefore used for lung and eye infections. Many of Labrador tea\'s medicinal properties come from fragrant essential oils within, making it also good as a mouth wash to remedy bad breath. Natives used it to help with child labor. They also used it to treat Type 2 diabetes and research now confirms this. Some practical uses for the plant include infusing the leaves into an oil to make an insect repellent. Crushed leaves can deter moths, and rodents from food storage. The pigments of Labrador tea have been used to stain wood and dye wool.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Food uses</h3>\r\n<p>The dried herb can be ground into a powder to add an interesting flavor to foods, sauces, and salad dressings. It has been used by the indigenous and others to season meat, similar to mint or vanilla and can be a substitute for both. The leaves can act as a bay leaf substitute, releasing flavor into soups or stews. High in vitamin C, Labrador tea was used as a substitute for black tea and to prevent scurvy in pioneer times. It also contains high amounts of beneficial antioxidants which are good for overall health.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Labrador Tea Blooming\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240619_034228436-387.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Precautions</h3>\r\n<p>Be sure to take Labrador tea in moderation. No more than two cups of tea per day and not for extended periods. Don\'t use if pregnant or if you have high blood pressure. It\'s quite potent and high in tannins that act to invigorate and detoxify, however this can backfire and become toxic if higher than normal amount are ingested. Common problems include diarrhea and even paralysis, so while Labrador tea can be very beneficial, be sure not to over do it.</p>', '[{\"id\":\"382\",\"name\":\"PXL_20241123_225855352.PORTRAIT-382.jpg\",\"tag\":\"1\",\"description\":\"Labrador Tea in the Winter\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"featured\"},{\"id\":\"383\",\"name\":\"PXL_20240701_153627136-383.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Labrador Tea Blooming\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"},{\"id\":\"384\",\"name\":\"PXL_20240701_153602705-384.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Labrador Tea Flowers\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"},{\"id\":\"385\",\"name\":\"PXL_20240528_233021710.MP-385.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Labrador Tea Habitat\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"},{\"id\":\"386\",\"name\":\"PXL_20241123_230001810.PORTRAIT-386.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Labrador Tea Seed Pods\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"},{\"id\":\"387\",\"name\":\"PXL_20240619_034228436-387.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Labrador Tea Blooming\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"}]', 2, '2024-12-25', NULL),
(253, 'growing-goldenrod-from-seed', 'Growing Goldenrod From Seed', '<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"Goldenrod Seedlings\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240802_165354578.MP-389.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>There\'s many reasons to grow goldenrod from seed. Beautiful clusters of golden-yellow flowers appear late summer to early fall, decorating roadsides and slopes. It\'s also a great pollinator plant, attracting bees, butterflies, and other pollinators to the area. As a medicinal, it\'s been used by Indigenous Peoples and is well known for pain relief, sore throats, allergies, skin conditions and other ailments.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Goldenrod in the Field\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230819_171410721-390.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Gathering Goldenrod Seeds</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s quite easy to grow these beautiful wildflowers and if naturally nearby you can easily gather the seeds yourself. From early fall to end of season, goldenrod flowers give way to spikes of fluffy seed heads. They can actually be quite decorative in a garden or cut and put in a vase. There\'s thousands of them per plant, so you probably won\'t need visit too many to gather what you need.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Goldenrod Seed Heads\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240913_022931115.MP-388.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n <p>Simply remove some from the seed cluster or cut the entire head off and store it in a felt, mesh, or canvas bag. It\'s always good to harvest seed when they\'re dry if possible, but if not just make sure to dry them soon after bringing them home. Lay them out on a flat surface away from strong winds and rain. In a couple of days or when the stems are brittle is a good indicator they\'re dry enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Goldenrod Seed Head\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230819_171540462-391.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Separating The Seeds</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Next you\'ll need to separate the seeds from the small stems that hold them in a cluster. You can simply pluck them off by hand, but if you need to do this in larger amounts then threshing will be needed. I\'ve made a simple thresher by using a bucket, electric drill, and some chains attached to a long bolt (chains were wedged between nuts that screw onto the long bolt). I found this design watching a YouTube video, but it can be found in multiple sources online.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Goldenrod Thresher\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20250103_220537495-396.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<p>Simply place the entire head(s) in the bucket, close the lid, attach the top of the long bolt to the drill and start drilling. The chains will thrash the goldenrod, releasing fluffy seeds off the stem. At this point you can either move onto the next step, or process them a bit further (optional). Each seed has silky hairs attached to make it air born. To remove the hairs, you can crab a handful of seeds and rub them through a sieve. This will separate out the hairs, letting actual seed pass out the bottom. </p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Sieving Goldenrod\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20250103_214626400.MP-397.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<p>You can then winnow the mixture to further separate seeds from hairs. Do this by slowly dropping the mixture in front of a gentle fan onto a large piece of paper or smooth surface. The hairs will ideally blow further away from the fan (since they\'re lighter) while the finished seed will drop more directly down infront of it. You can then gather the processed seed. I find these last few steps to not be necessary unless you have reason for the fluff to be removed. It\'s necessary to remove them from the stem, but they\'ll germinate just fine if you leave them with fluff attached.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Goldenrod Seeds\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240913_023029161.MP-394.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Stratifying</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The seeds will need to be exposed to cold temperatures over winter to break their dormancy (stratification). this can be done by simply planting them outside in the fall and let nature do its job, or by stratifying them yourself. To do this, place the seeds in a ziplock bag with some sand, perlite, or vermiculite to keep them separated. The ratio I use is about 2 parts sand to one part seed. Add just enough water to the mixture to moisten it without making it soaking wet. Place the bag in the fridge, or ideally outside in the winter for about one to two months.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Stratifying Goldenrod\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20250103_221546447-398.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Planting</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Goldenrod plants aren\'t very fussy about soil quality, but ideally use any soil mix with decent drainage and nothing too rich. Make sure seeds (or the stratified seed mixture) is spread out on the soil surface or just below it since they will need light to germinate. Plant them in a non shaded area, or expose your tray or pot to full sun. Once the weather warms up, seed should germinate in one to two weeks, but some can take longer as many native plants do. Keep them moist but not waterlogged until established.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Nursery seedlings\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240802_165335869.MP-393.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<p>If you\'re growing the seedlings as transplants, you can plant them into their new location as soon as they have their first set of true leaves or seem sturdy enough to handle. Again, they will thrive in poor soil, just avoid overly rich or wet areas. An open meadow, forest edge, or sunny slope is a good place for establishing goldenrod.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"Goldenrod Flowers\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230801_154239185-395.jpg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>They shouldn\'t need much attention from this point on as they\'ll spread naturally from rhizomes and self seeding. Goldenrod likes to grow in disturbed soil so cutting down tall grass, digging, or raking the dirt around an existing patch should help it spread if that\'s what you desire. Few things are more satisfying than growing your own native plants, and goldenrod is no exception.

As a native plant enthusiast, I was excited to find out this pretty little windflower is native to North America (I\'m in BC, Canada). I didn\'t think it was medical in any way, but after some research was pleasant surprised to hear of others using it and the range of medicinal actions it can potentially have. I should mention, I have no firsthand experience from this herb so the below is purely research, but I\'ve grown it from seed, and will talk about that in a bit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though considered a weed to some, this plant is said to have numerous medicinal benefits and has been used by indigenous North American peoples for centuries. Uses include hemorrhaging, stomach upset, respiratory issues, bladder problems, and use as a women\'s herb. Philadelphia fleabane (also known as common fleabane), and Daisy fleabane (also called annual fleabane) are both commonly used and native to North America. For Europeans reading, there\'s also have an old world version of this plant native to Europe, the European common fleabane. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The name fleabane has a meaning behind it. Bane is associated with poison, death, and harm. That\'s why plants with the word bane in them are often poisonous (like red and white baneberry for example). But the \"bane\" in this case refers to fleabane\'s past use as a pest control. The dried flowers and stems were put in mattress stuffing, in brooms, and used in and around homes to repel fleas. Modern findings doubt fleabane actually repels fleas, but we\'re left now with an interesting story behind the name, like many other medicinal plants.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Identification</h3>\r\n<p>Fleabane can be found on property edges, roadsides, meadows, and waters edge. Its considered a \"pioneer\" species because it can pop up as one of the early newcomers in recently disturbed areas.\r\nThe flowers are quite small, with a miniature daisy-like appearance. Most flowers are white, but can be tinged with purple or pink. Probably fleabane\'s most prominent feature is the flower petals (ray florets ) which are quite fine and almost hair-like compared to other daisies. Leaves from the top part of the plant differ in shape to leaves at the bottom part of the plant. Below is a picture of the upper, oppositely arranged leaves from Philadelphia fleabane; notice they somewhat clasp the hairy stem.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Fleabane leaves\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240918_213450481.MP-401.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of lookalilkes, asters are probably the most similar in appearance to fleabanes, but asters bloom much later in season and the petals are thicker and of different colour. Behind the flower heads of asters are multiple rows of leaves overlapping like shingles. Fleabanes have just one to two rows behind the flowerhead that resemble a simple flat \"fence\" in appearance. Fleabanes can be annual, biennial, or a short lived perennial, whereas asters are usually perennial (longer lived through multiple seasons). See the example \"showy aster\" pic below.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"Showy Aster Leaves\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230727_012129904-402.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption>Showy Aster</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<h3>Harvesting and Preparation</h3>\r\n<p>Fleabane has edible leaves, but it isn\'t normally used as a food because of the bitter taste and lack of plentiful edible parts; rather it lends its self well to be prepared as a tonic or medicine plant to treat specific needs. Harvest in late spring, gathering just the flowering tops that have a healthy bright yellow center. You can cut the top third of the plant off with scissors and include some stems and leaves. For drying, place the plant material on screens in a well ventilated area or use a dehydrator. \r\nTo make a tea, steep fresh or dried leaves and flower tops in water that\'s just been boiled. Some really love the flavor, some are indifferent to it and say it\'s bland. The plant can also be prepared as a tincture to take in drop form, or as oils or salves for topical use.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Medicinal Actions</h3>\r\n<p>Fleabane has astringent, diuretic, as well as anti-inflammatory properties. These are simply medicinal actions that have certain therapeutic affects within the body. The gallic acid and other tannins within fleabane have an anti-inflammatory effect that may help to relieve pain, stiffness, sore muscles, and rheumatism. It\'s also been used for headaches, as many migraines can be triggered by enlarged, enflamed blood vessels. The plant has also been used to treat external inflammation like burns, which are inflamed and swollen areas of the skin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps one of fleabane\'s best knows strengths is as an astringent. Astringent herbs cause tissues to tighten and shrink, sealing and drying leaky sores. This can be useful for internal wounding, to help stop bleeding within the body. GI tract issues like bloating and damaged intestinal walls from \"leaky gut syndrome\", diarrhea, and dysentery are all issues fleabane has been used for. Specifically, Canadian fleabane is said to be quite effective for ulcerative colitis. Again, likely due to compounds like tannins, which cause the contraction and tightening of mucous membranes in the gastrointestinal tract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fleabane\'s\' astringent properties are said to be great for pains and complications that often haunt women\'s reproductive systems; also to help regulate periods, suppress heavy menstruation, and treat childbirth hemorrhage. Again, it\'s likely the astringent properties toning and tightening the smooth muscles within the uterine area, and allowing the sealing of leaky internal wounding and bleeding.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Other Medicinal Actions </h3>\r\n<p>Fleabane has been used as a diuretic, allowing the liver to increase urine flow, ridding the body of extra fluid, and helping to remove toxins and salts. As such, it\'s been used to treat things like urinary tract issues. Respiratory system issues like coughs and congestion are another possible use. It\'s said to clear mucus from the lungs, induce sneezing, and treat head colds. The Cherokee, blackfoot, Houma, Ojibwa, Houma, Meskwaki, Iroquois and other native peoples have traditionally used this herb. Here are some of their uses in summary:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>gout</li>\r\n <li>fever </li>\r\n <li>epilupsy</li>\r\n <li>the caughing up of blood</li>\r\n <li>heart support by increased circulation </li>\r\n <li>skin irritations, sores, and insect bites</li>\r\n <li>used in smoking tobacco</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Growing Fleabane From Seed</h3>\r\n<p>This little plant is very easy to grow (unlike some native plants). Flowers turn to fluffy seed heads in the fall. Where I am in Northern BC this is about late September. Collect them and simply remove the fluffy seeds by hand by plucking them. They can then be spread in a thin layer on the surface of any loose soil and just barely covered with sand or soil dust. It\'s important they\'re lightly covered, not buried since the seeds will need light to germinate. Fleabane is a prolific reproducer, one seed head should be more than enough for your needs! In a couple of weeks you should see little florets pop out of the soil. See below...</p>\r\n\r\n <img alt=\"Fleabane Seedlings\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20250927_191207748_exported_0-407.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<p>Keep them moist but not wet, they like things well drained. Once this size they can then be transplanted by hand into bigger containers or into the garden or field. Just be careful not too harm the roots too much if you can help it. Once established they\'re low maintenance, pretty much care free wildflowers.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Precautions</h3>\r\n<p>Don\'t use if pregnant as it affects the uterus and could induce miscarriage. Don\'t use if breastfeeding or on blood pressure meds or blood thinners. Avoid if you\'re allergic to plants in the aster family. Always consult multiple reputable sources to properly identify the plant before using it as food or medicine. I\'ve read some species such as spreading fleabane are considered mildly toxic, but have also read this species was traditionally used to treat various things. Either way, there are over 350 types of fleabane and it\'s a good idea to identify which one you\'re dealing with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>due to the possible slightly toxic characteristics of it\'s oils, it\'s probably best not to use long term; and though, this fleabane has been used for a very long time traditionally, it isn\'t widely studied in modern days for it\'s medicinal use and proven clinically on human trials. Lastly, like all medicinal herbs, avoid if taking other medications and always consult a healthcare professional before using plants medicinally. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Other Benefits</h3>\r\n<p>With all the benefits fleabane has to offer, it can also be an attractive wildflower in the garden, beneficial to the local ecosystem, and supportive to both native bees and moths. The flower can also help attract predatory insects that deal with unwanted pesky ones in a natural way. Personally I\'ve missed harvest season for fleabane unfortunately, and am writing this in the winter while I have time on my hands. But I\'m looking forward to connecting with this amazing plant and brewing up a nice cup of fleabane tea in the spring when it\'s in full bloom! Happy foraging!</p>', '[{\"id\":\"400\",\"name\":\"PXL_20240918_213437718-400.jpg\",\"tag\":\"1\",\"description\":\"Fleabane flowers\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"featured\"},{\"id\":\"401\",\"name\":\"PXL_20240918_213450481.MP-401.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Fleabane leaves\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"},{\"id\":\"402\",\"name\":\"PXL_20230727_012129904-402.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Showy Aster Leaves\",\"caption\":\"Showy Aster\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"},{\"id\":\"407\",\"name\":\"PXL_20250927_191207748_exported_0-407.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Fleabane Seedlings\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"}]', 2, '2025-11-11', NULL),
(255, 'the-most-powerful-medicinal-mint', 'The Most Powerful Medicinal Mint', '<img alt=\"wild mint\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240904_234532356.MP-403.jpg\" />\r\n<p>Lets talk about an amazing mint I love to use, and it\'s not the one everyone is talking about. There\'s over 7000 herbs belonging to the mint (Lamiaceae) family worldwide. Some popular varieties are: basil, mint, sage, thyme, oregano, and rosemary. Most are known for high essential oil content that gives them their incredible aroma. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first Peppermint (Mentha piperita) seems to be the mint plant of choice for its globally standardized medicinal properties and has been studied in over 1000 research papers. The primary active medicinal ingredient in peppermint is menthol, which is responsible for its cooling sensation, strong aroma, and many of its medicinal properties. The percentage of menthol in peppermint generally ranges from about 30% to 78% of the essential oil. Many sources claim peppermint to fame for it\'s high menthol and resulting strong medicinal abilities, which are truly time tested and acclaimed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wild mint (Mentha arvensis), also known as corn mint, field mint, or Japanese peppermint, however is a different plant, studied but less so than the well known than common peppermint. It turns out is this species of mint is known to have the highest menthol content of all mints, and is the primary natural source that menthol is harvested globally. This is due to its exceptionally high menthol concentration of 70% to 90%, the major producers being India and China. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I first came across wild mint I could smell the aroma in the air well before finding the plant. I was so exciting to identify one popping out of the damp rivers edge, then I noticed another stem nearby, and another, and so on. Wild mind grows in colonies and often in high abundance In young poplar groves, muskegs, or wet areas by streams and other waters edge. It can be identified by square stems (like all other mints), and opposite leaves, potentially with flower clusters where the leaves meet the stem. But the best identifying factor is it\'s unmistakably strong minty aroma. It\'s best to harvest when in full bloom to maximize the essential oil content as this is when it boasts its strength as a therapeutic herb and potent medicinal.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"wild mint flowers\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240818_005357759-406.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Many wild plants, including wild mint have been used for thousands of years by ancient Egyptians, ancient Greeks and Romans, various First Nations/Native American tribes, and in traditional Chinese Medicine. Their effectiveness though sometime forgotten is time tested. Mentha arvensis is among the most accessible medicinal herbs, found worldwide (Mentha canadensis is the equivalent North American variety). Wild mint is also often found in abundance. A simple stroll through damp woods or waters edge is bound to spark an encounter, with a wild mint patch. While Peppermint is considered a sterile hybrid, of watermint + spearmint and can only be reproduced by cutting, wild mint seeds readily in high amounts. They\'re very easy to grow as long as they get plenty of moisture and I plan to write an article about growing wild mint in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Propagating wild mint\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240805_220245244.MP-405.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Medicinal Actions</h3>\r\n<p>Perhaps one of wild mint\'s best medicinal actions is to aid digestion and relieve symptoms of digestive issues like gas, bloating, and indigestion. It\'s also traditionally used to stimulate circulation and help with respiratory symptoms and pain. Inhaling the essential oil is also said to improve brain function, and like other mints it can be used to help mask bad breath.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mint is commonly used as a catalyst or synergist herb when included with other herbs, making the combination more powerful and effective. The concept of \"catalyst\" refers to herbs which improve the bioavailability, and delivery of other herbs within the body. The aromatic essential oil quality of mint increases circulation, helping deliver less active herbs to places of need in the body. The term \"synergist\" refers to those which enhance medicinal actions when combined with other herbs. For example, mint combined with sage can potentially be a much more effective for certain medicinal actions than each herb alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Canada mint growing wild\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240610_183656007-404.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<p>This article isn\'t meant to put peppermint down. Don\'t get me wrong, peppermint is an astounding medicinal with a long history of proven clinical use, and even has it\'s own natural range in the middle east. But I want to bring to light how powerful and available wild mint really is. There is something about finding a wild plant that actually grows naturally in your area, then identifying it and realizing it\'s been used for thousands of years by many ancient peoples. Lastly, incorporating properly identified wild herbs into your body for health and wellbeing is where the connection really starts. You may have even been inspired to look for it, and find out it\'s been placed there for you all along because there\'s something you need that it has to give.</p>', '[{\"id\":\"403\",\"name\":\"PXL_20240904_234532356.MP-403.jpg\",\"tag\":\"1\",\"description\":\"wild mint\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"featured\"},{\"id\":\"404\",\"name\":\"PXL_20240610_183656007-404.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Canada mint growing wild\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"},{\"id\":\"405\",\"name\":\"PXL_20240805_220245244.MP-405.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Propagating wild mint\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"},{\"id\":\"406\",\"name\":\"PXL_20240818_005357759-406.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"wild mint flowers\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"}]', 2, '2025-11-16', NULL),
(256, 'chinese-medicine-connects-herbs-with-people', 'Chinese Medicine Connects Herbs With People', '<img alt=\"Chinese herbal medicine\" src=\"/uploads/articles/L3-–-Traditional-Chinese-Health-Hero-411.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<p>When I was a kid, I remember going to China town with my Mom and entering the small shop full of little wooden drawers. The lady who worked there opened one of them, grabbed some peculiar looking dried red berries, bend down to my level and gave them to me saying \"here, take these, they\'re good for you\". I was so amazed she game me something for free and was excited to see what magical effects would happen when I ate them!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later, after many trials in life including computer related jobs that left my mind, body, and emotions broken, I developed an interest in plants and went back to school for horticulture. I eventually got into foraging and growing medicinal plants for food and medicine. I Always wondered though, how do I actually know HOW to use these herbs? What herbs go well together, and what do I take them with and when? And if I\'m spending all this time cooking for the family, how can I dedicate time to also prepare herbs for medicine? If these herbs are also food, can\'t I just cook with them?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In books I would read about how some herbs being warming or cooling, moistening or drying. What does this mean and why does it matter? I noticed not all herbs have the same effect, even if they belong to the same family or genus. This led me to find out about herbal energetics and how these warming, or cooling effects mattered because it had to do with the person they were treating, what herbs they go with, and how they should be taken. I came to realize these principles were derived mainly from the over five thousand year practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and the dried fruit the lady handed to me when I was young were goji berries and they ARE very good for you. </p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Goji berries in Chinese herbal medicine\" src=\"/uploads/articles/bowl_of_goji_berrie-410.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Adaptive vs Mechanical</h3>\r\n<p>Whereas western medicine is built on the knowledge of the physical body as a machine, Chinese medicine Can be thought of as more symbolic and holistic. Knowledge of the workings of the body are derived from patterns observed in nature. Being more of an artistic thinker myself, this concept seems like second nature, less about the need for memorization of specific compounds and more about the feel and behavior of the same life force systems and how they all connect. Let\'s compare it to this, instead of memorizing 100 recipes with their own ingredients, what about learning about what tastes go well together and cooking 100 dishes given the ingredients you have? Ofcourse in western medicine, there are general concepts and in Chinese medicine there is still lots of detailed components to remember but this is the general idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In TCM, habits should coincide with the rhythm of the seasons and time of day. For example, eating warming foods in winter, cooling foods in Summer, activity in the day, and slowing down at night. In Chinese medicine, organs such as the heart, spleen, and liver are symbolic rather than describing the actual organs as seen in western medicine. For example, the liver resembles wood, with a behavior of flow, direction, and planning. The heart resembles fire, with a behavior of consciousness, joy, and connection. The spleen resembles earth, with a behavior of nourishment, meaning, and stability. In TCM the heart houses the mind. Obviously it doesn\'t physically do so in real life, but it\'s a concept that solves certain patterns in the body the would link the heart to the mind. Interestingly, even in old English we see a relationship between the heart and mind in many meanings and words such as \"hearts desire\" and being \"whole hearted\".</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Chinese herbal medicine\" src=\"/uploads/articles/chinese-herbal-medicine-home-409.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<p>TCM brings me back to deep thought when I was younger, the more creative, artistic, and with a curious view of the world type of person. By studying Chinese medicine, you may even find that you start looking at the world differently and how much of a connection to nature and the universe our bodies really have. You don\'t really need to know how the physical organs work (though it is of course good to know as well), rather how observe what is happening in the many outward aspects of physical being, and then measure how to bring the body back to harmony so it can heal its self. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A Holistic, Non Disease-Specific Approach</h3>\r\n<p>In TCM, the Body as an Interrelated system, where one issue can show up in different parts of the body because everything is connected. For example, stress (an emotional imbalance) can cause headaches, digestive problems, and sleep issues. This has been known in Chinese medicine for a very long time, and may seem obvious, but this mind to body connection is a relatively new concept to western medicine.<br>\r\nTCM is less about treating a specific ailment or a specific part of the body. There aren\'t really eye or foot specialists in TCM because it\'s recognized how deeply connected the body is as a whole and one part must be addressed from different many angles.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Other Half of Herbal Medicine</h3>\r\n<p>After learning the basics medicinal plants, I realized there is another, equally important half of herbal medicine I was missing besides knowing the herbs themselves.. that is knowing the person and how to connect the person to the herbs. Chinese medicine provides a way to actually use your collection of herbs. This is where the concept of energetics comes into play. For example, Ginger is warm, and pungent. It moves Qi, dispels cold, warms the stomach and stops nausea. It\'s used for releasing external cold, early colds, chills, mild fever. It should not be use however if you experience excess heat, dryness or severe thirst. Energetics Treats your gender, also your age and stage of life. For example, ginger may connect well is a \"cool\" body type person but less with a \"hot\" body type. TCM also covers what combinations of herbs to use when to use them. That said,\r\nit\'s not about using specific Chinese herbs, but the concept of how to use them. Western herbs can even be used in TCM and this may be the subject of a future article. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Empowers the Everyday Person</h3>\r\n<p>With traditional medicine regular people can take health into their own hands without expensive equipment and decades of schooling. The practice integrates with everyday life using simple concepts that are understandable by regular people herbs that can be grown and gathered, and needles (for those trained in acupuncture).</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Yin Yang\" src=\"/uploads/articles/yin-yang-99824_1280-412.png\" />\r\n\r\n<p>Yin and yang are forces recognized as long as TCM have been around. Yin represents coolness, darkness, moisture, and substance. On the other hand Yang represents warmth, light, function and vapor. These patterns can be seen by simply looking upon the changing light as it darkens one side of a hill (which is believed to be the origin of yin-yang observation). The idea of yin and yang can be understood by all people and the idea applies in the body, where yin is the body’s cooling, nourishing, calming side and yang is the body’s warming, moving, energizing side. If there is fatigue and cold, yang is too weak; use yin herbs and foods. If there is heat signs with dryness, yin too weak; use yang herbs and foods. Of course it can get far more complex than this, and there\'s limitless growth in TCM but much can be done only using basic concepts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TCM Focuses more on prevention than fixing serious problems after they arise (Chinese medicine helps with serious fixing too but This is where western medicine may be necessary). As mentioned, it integrates with food, what to eat when. For example, food should be prepared hot or warm, especially in the winter. Also avoiding certain foods when sick. While many conventional doctors seldom ask a patient of their lifestyle habits, it\'s said in TCM that food is the best medicine.. This can be seen in the many traditional soups eaten at certain times a year that contain medicinal ingredients designed to nourish and recover during times of fatigue, or to warm and protect in times of hovering illness.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Chinese herbal medicine\" src=\"/uploads/articles/acupuncture-traditional-chinese-medicine-2-408.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<p>This article is not meant to rule out western medicine, but to prove they can work in tandem and there\'s definitely room for both depending on the situation. Interestingly, there\'s much overlap between both hemispheres in terms of the outcome they both create in different ways.\r\nIt seems the life we live these days has a way of changing us. Work, fear, and the harsh realities of life have a way of draining our connection with nature that came so easily to us as children and close to God. I didn\'t even realize how much I\'ve changed and lost touch with \"meaningful\" things until connecting with plants and with this age old way of treating individuals that just seems so natural. Being of Chinese descent on my father\'s side, TCM feels right for me, but whether it be Chinese medicine, ayurvedic medicine, reiki, or the many others, it\'s important to look to your roots, your interests, what calls you and feels right to you because this other half of herbalism, the \"energetics\" has to do with the individual; with your roots and how you resonate. From there you\'ll be able go out and help your family, possibly even your friends, and maybe even community more accurately, confidently, and holistically.</p>', '[{\"id\":\"408\",\"name\":\"acupuncture-traditional-chinese-medicine-2-408.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Chinese herbal medicine\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"},{\"id\":\"409\",\"name\":\"chinese-herbal-medicine-home-409.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Chinese herbal medicine\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"},{\"id\":\"410\",\"name\":\"bowl_of_goji_berrie-410.jpg\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Goji berries in Chinese herbal medicine\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"},{\"id\":\"411\",\"name\":\"L3-\\u2013-Traditional-Chinese-Health-Hero-411.jpg\",\"tag\":\"1\",\"description\":\"Chinese herbal medicine\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"featured\"},{\"id\":\"412\",\"name\":\"yin-yang-99824_1280-412.png\",\"tag\":\"2\",\"description\":\"Yin Yang\",\"caption\":\"\",\"tag_name\":\"standard\"}]', 2, '2025-12-16', NULL),

In northern BC, this is typically in the fall or early October.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"alder cones ripe for seed collection\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240923_224021155.MP-419.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Let the cones sit in a breathable bag, like a paper bag, for a couple of weeks to a month. This allows them to use their energy to mature, dry, and open without the seeds scattering everywhere. If you pick the pods when they are woody, most of the seeds may have already weathered and been released; this is why we pick them slightly immature. Once dry, tap the small winged seeds out onto a table or shake them in a bucket to release more.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"alder seeds\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20250220_010344372-418.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<p>Mix the seeds with some sand or perlite. This helps separate and disperse them evenly, and provides a medium for stratification. Since alder trees naturally grow in colder climates, the seeds need exposure to cold weather to simulate winter before they will sprout. Moisten the sand (not soggy, just moist), and place it outside in the cold or in the fridge for 2 to 3 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"stratifying alder\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20250220_012516399-417.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<p>In spring, spread the seed mixture on loose soil. If you need to thin the seeds further, add more sand to the mixture first. Sprinkle a little soil on top, but make sure the seeds aren’t buried too deeply, as they need light to germinate. Keep the soil constantly moist, but not waterlogged. Maintaining moisture throughout the process is very important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The seeds should germinate in about a month or less, though germination can be sporadic, popping up here and there like many native plants. Seedlings will be quite delicate and small at first. If possible, use a sprayer or misting system to water them until they are ready to transplant, which usually takes about one growing season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These seedlings were sprouted from seeds collected two seasons ago. Germination rates might have been better if the seeds had been from the previous fall, but this shows that alder seeds have some longevity even if planting is delayed for a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"alder seedling\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20250921_005909434-414.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<p>Growing alder from seed takes a bit of patience and attention, but growing wild plants and trees can be quite rewarding.

The search for gentle allies from the plant world draws many to herbs that nourish calm and restore balance. Among these allies stands skullcap, a member of the mint family that\'s found its way into traditional cultures and modern herbal medicine as a friend for the weary spirit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Skullcap, belonging to the genus Scutellaria, has a history as old as herbal healing itself. Native to temperate regions of North America and Eurasia, it was known to Indigenous peoples long before Europeans gave it a name. These early healers observed how Skullcap encouraged rest and soothed tension, helping the mind settle after a demanding day of living close to the land.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><figure>\r\n<img alt=\"Skullcap flowers\" src=\"/uploads/articles/Scutellaria_baicalensis_inflorescence-421.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption>Photo by Alex Abair, licensed under CC BY-4.0 via Wikimedia Commons (originally from iNaturalist)</figcaption>\r\n</figure></div>\r\n\r\n<p>As settlers came to North America, European herbalists began to work with this plant, attracted to its delicate blue flowers and its gentle effect on the nerves. Meanwhile in the East, Traditional Chinese Medicine honored a close cousin called Huang Qin, Scutellaria baicalensis. Although these plants share a botanical lineage, they are not identical and their gifts are used in different ways. The Chinese herb is stronger, more focused on clearing heat, supporting liver and digestive harmony, and easing inflammation, while the North American Scutellaria lateriflora speaks more softly to the nervous system.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding Skullcap in the Wild and in the Garden</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You will know Skullcap once you learn its form. Its stems are squared as is common in the mint family, and its leaves grow in opposite pairs, oval and lightly serrated. The flowers bloom along the stem in tender shades of blue and violet. It grows along moist woodland edges, stream banks, and shaded meadows, but adapts easily to a tended garden bed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike many of its mint family relatives, Skullcap is not aromatic. It does not fill the air with strong fragrance like mint or basil. Its character is quieter, suited to its soothing nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Western Herbalism and the Nervous System</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In Western folk herbalism, Skullcap became well known for its role as a nervine, an herb that strengthens and calms the nervous system. Herbalists often reach for it for people who feel overwhelmed, unsettled, or pulled in too many directions. It is often used when anxiety blends with exhaustion, when sleep is broken and the mind refuses to let go of the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>People choose Skullcap for:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>Stress that has worn the body down</li>\r\n <li>Depression rooted in exhaustion and chronic tension</li>\r\n <li>Restless thoughts at night</li>\r\n <li>Emotional imbalance from the pace of modern life</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike stronger calming agents, Skullcap does not force the body into submission. It reminds the nervous system how to settle itself, much like sitting beside a river and listening until your breathing deepens without being asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Its TCM Cousin: Not the Same Herb</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine works mainly with Scutellaria baicalensis, Huang Qin, used to clear heat, purge irritation, and support the liver system. It may be part of formulas for digestive imbalance, skin irritation, or respiratory heat. While both herbs belong to the same family, their healing voices differ. Western Skullcap nourishes the nervous system like a blanket and a soft pillow at the end of a long day, while Huang Qin works more like a breeze that cools fevered states in the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Different from Other Mint Family Herbs</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Though part of the mint family, Skullcap stands apart. Peppermint energizes, lemon balm brightens and uplifts, basil activates the appetite and mind. Skullcap instead moves inward and downward, inviting the spirit to unclench. It is the herbalist’s companion for those who cannot rest not because they do not want to, but because their nervous system has forgotten how.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A Classic Herbal Preparation</h3>\r\n\r\nOne of the most cherished preparations is a simple tea.\r\nSkullcap Evening Tea Ingredients:\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>One to two teaspoons dried Skullcap leaf and flower</li>\r\n <li>One cup of recently boiled water</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nMethod\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>Place Skullcap in a cup or teapot</li>\r\n <li>Pour hot water over it</li>\r\n <li>Cover and steep ten to fifteen minutes</li>\r\n <li>Strain and drink</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This tea is ideal in the late afternoon or evening, especially during seasons of high stress or emotional heaviness.\r\nSome herbalists blend Skullcap with oatstraw for deep nourishment or with lemon balm for a brighter calming effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Safety Considerations</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Begin with small doses and notice your body’s response, and choose high quality sources that clearly identify Scutellaria lateriflora, as some commercial products have been adulterated. Pregnant or breastfeeding individuals, those taking sedatives or mood medications, and people with significant medical concerns should consult a trained herbalist or practitioner before use. Skullcap may cause drowsiness in sensitive individuals, so avoid taking it before activities that require alertness and offer smaller amounts to children or the elderly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A Plant For Our Times</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Skullcap holds a message for modern people: there is strength in slowing down. When stress begins to shape your mood, when your shoulders stiffen and your thoughts tangle, let a cup of Skullcap tea be a pause, a return to yourself. For those who seek natural ways to care for themselves and their families, Skullcap offers companionship for the journey back to balance.

(260, 'growing-and-harvesting-skullcap', 'Growing and Harvesting Skullcap', '<p>Skullcap is an easy plant to grow and rewards even modest care. It prefers moist soil and partial shade, mimicking the stream banks and woodland edges where it grows naturally. Choose a spot that doesn\'t dry out completely, or water regularly during dry periods. Skullcap can be grown from seed or started from young plants, and once established it often returns year after year.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"skullcap\" src=\"/uploads/articles/Scutellaria_lateriflora_01-423.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Seeds are best sown in early spring, either directly in the garden or started indoors and transplanted once the risk of frost has passed. The plant grows low and spreading, with delicate blue flowers appearing early to midsummer. It doesn\'t compete well with aggressive plants, so keep the area lightly weeded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harvest Skullcap when it is in flower, as this is when its calming properties are at their peak. Cut the upper portions of the plant, leaving enough growth at the base for it to continue thriving. Dry the harvest quickly in a well ventilated shaded area, spreading the herb in a thin layer. Once fully dry, store in a glass jar away from light and heat. Properly dried Skullcap keeps its strength for about one year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Growing Skullcap at home deepens your relationship with the plant and ensures the medicine you prepare carries freshness intention and care.

(261, 'medicinal-alder', 'Medicinal Alder', '<img alt=\"green alder cones\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230707_143558849-424.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<p>In this article we\'ll talk about the many benefits to this amazing tree including identifying, harvesting, and its medicinal effects. \r\nAlder is a shrub to small tree of the birch family, found by rivers and lake shores often growing in thickets. There are many species of alder, the most commonly known medicinally are the black, red, and Japanese Alder. Known as a \"pioneer species\", alder helps to establish new soil with its nitrogen fixing abilities, and short lifespan, dying down to replenish the ground. We have small alder trees growing in thickets in and around the ditches all around our property here in northern BC. They grow alongside pussy willow, wild rose, and young poplar trees.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"alder shrubs\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240923_224042242.MP-426.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<h3>How To Identify Alder</h3>\r\n<p>leaves are somewhat unique, and have creases running along them resembling ruffles potato chips. The leaf edges are double toothed (one tooth inside another). The twigs are fairly fine like that of a birch tree, not fat and chunky like a black walnut or balsam poplar tree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bark is smooth, usually gray, dark brown or dull green. Younger wood is speckled with light bumps, often in a horizontal pattern (lenticels). With age, the bark may have white blotches (lichens). The tree can also be found with usnea hanging from it (hairy fungus that grows in damp forests).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps the most noticeable feature is the catkins. These hang from the tree in both male and female form. The male ones are long narrow pollen producing flower strings, the female ones are peculiar cone-like woody oval or round balls. Female catkins are unmistakable, the only thing like it seen on a broadeaf tree. The catkins start our fleshy and green before they mature.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"alder winter cones\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240410_194824772.MP-429.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Pain and Inflammation</h3>\r\n<p>The inner bark of alder is very astringent and contains salicin which has pain-relieving (analgesic), anti-inflammatory, and fever-reducing actions. This is that same aspirin-like compound found in willow trees. An infusion of the bark can be used for like headaches, arthritis, rheumatism, back pain, muscle sores, and other pain and inflammation related conditions. A bark decoction (fresh or dried) can be used as a gargle for sore throats, also for pains in the mouth and infected gums. The leaves can be inserted directly on the bottom of feet inside shoes while hiking, or soak feet in a foot bath of alder leaves to relieve achy feet. Sore hands can be treated in the same way.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Skin Issues</h3>\r\n<p>As an astringent, alder tightens and contracts skin and muscles internally or externally. Outside of the body a cream, oil, or salve can be useful to close wounds. It also stops bleeding and shortens bleeding time as a hemostatic. A cream or face wash can be used on acne to tighten the pores. For skin fungal, or bacterial related sores, a water based preparation like a wash, compress, or poultice should be used topically. This applies also to blistery eczema, itching from Chicken pox, bug bites, and hemorrhoids.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"alder catkins\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240402_210310384-428.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Stomach Issues and Digestion</h3>\r\n<p>Digestive relief is another great benefit of medicinal alder. The astringency helps tighten a loose digestive tract, forming a protective barrier to decrease gut surface irritation and inflammation, helping with things like stomach ache and diarrhea. As a bitter it also activates the digestion system before meals and triggers the digestive fluids to flow. Since it\'s also antimicrobial, alder helps clear out unwanted pathogens as well. This combination of protective and activating properties make alder a good stomach tonic, but one for short term use so it doesn\'t disrupt the good flora of the gut!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Viruses</h3>\r\n<p>Alder has been used to help fight off cold, flu, and viral related illnesses. The dysentery effects of alder can help lower fevers, and the same antimicrobial properties useful on wounds can useful in the body when sick. These effects, include antifungal, antibacterial, and antiviral properties. Alder is studied for use against HIV (to fight its unique behavior) and has been found to have antiviral actions against hepatitis. The tree has even been closely looked as as a plant to possibly fight corona virus for those with the onset disease. Flu fighting uses of alder are prepared in the form of a tea, decoction, or tincture to best extract its medicinal compounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Harvesting</h3>\r\n<p>Leaves, growing tips, young shoots, and inner bark from stems are all used in alder medicine. Harvest the bark in spring or autumn by shaving off small pieces, making sure not to cut all the way around the trunk and girdle it. Or harvest a single branch and use all the bark from it. The inner bark (cambium) is where the medicine is. This is the soft green or red lively part between the bark and the wood. It\'s totally fine to include the outer bark and some of the inner wood in the shavings just be conscious it\'s the cambium that\'s of value. Also take note the shavings should be thoroughly dried at least a year before using internally.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"green alder leaves\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230707_143816741-425.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<p>Live growing tips and leaves can be harvested throughout spring and summer ideally before flowering. Leaves can be used dried or fresh unlike the bark, making them more readily usable, crushed on the spot, or as a tea. The buds can be harvested from late winter to early spring to be prepared as a tincture or infused in oil for skin conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cleansing Tonic</h3>\r\n<p>Alder is sometimes said to be a tonic in western herbalism, in the category of herbs that increase overall health and vitality. But by tonic in alder\'s sense it\'s more of a cleansing, bitter digestive aid, and blood purifier. One that helps to move fluids and detoxify the body. Alder is somewhat of a alterative tonic, a blood cleanser and lymphatic remedy. Remember, when taking internally the inner bark is more astringent and emetic and must be dried first whereas the leaves can be fresh or dried.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Other uses </h3>\r\n<p>Alder has yet more benefits, such as being mucilaginous which soothes and moistens mucus membranes like the throat and sinuses. This can be a somewhat rare quality in herbs but a very important category as a way to treat \"dryness\" in the body such as dry cough, and inflamed tissues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alder contains the anti-tumor active ingredients lupeol and betulin for use against different types of cancer. It\'s also a diuretic, helping kidneys to remove salts and water from the body through urination. A study on cones of black alder revealed it to be very effective as a liver protector (hepatoprotective).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The male and female catkins of alder are edible and high in protein. They may be used fresh or dried as a survival food or in soups and stews. Catkins like those of birch, poplar and alder have high amounts of pollen which contain the protein, amino acid, and other nutrients that enable them to reproduce.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"alder cones\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230707_143659415-427.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Precautions</h3>\r\n<p>Though alder can be said a tonic, use in moderation and it\'s not generally for long term use. Avoid using fresh alder as it can have a bit of an emetic effect and induce vomiting and also become a strong laxative. Dry the bark first for at least one year before using to avoid this. The fresh leaves don\'t have the same emetic effect as the bark, but should still be used in moderation and not long term. Note: a strong decoction would not be ingested, but used either topically or as a gargle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alder is more of a short term, restorative, and cleansing remedy. Also, the antibacterial properties of alder can harm good bacteria in the body if used extensively, so use in moderation and in short term. Proper identification of the plant is always crucial with herbal medicine, also consult a health practitioner first if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or on any medications and thinking of taking alder.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>Unlike pharmaceuticals, herbs and trees often have many active constituents and can treat many ailments with just one plant. Alder is a perfect example of how few herbs one may need to treat so many things. As a potent wild medicine it needs a bit of understanding to be used properly, but the power and versatility of this holistic plant is worth the research.

It thrives along creeks, fence lines, forest edges, old homesteads, and compost piles. For the herbalist, small nursery grower, or homesteader, learning to grow stinging nettle from seed is both practical and deeply satisfying. It is easy to grow, abundant once established, and offers food, medicine, and fertility all in one plant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Growing nettle from seed also reconnects us with an older way of working with plants. Instead of buying starts every year, you can gather seed from the wild, sow it yourself, and slowly build a living relationship with a plant that has fed and healed people for thousands of years.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A Brief History of Stinging Nettle</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Stinging nettle has a long and well documented history of use as food and medicine across Europe, Asia, and North America. The European species, Urtica dioica, appears in ancient Greek texts and was written about by Hippocrates and Dioscorides. Romans reportedly used nettle to stimulate circulation and warmth during cold northern campaigns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Europe, nettle was traditionally eaten as a spring green, brewed into teas, used as a textile fiber, and applied externally for joint pain. Its value as a nutrient dense food during lean seasons made it a staple for rural communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>North America is fortunate to have its own native stinging nettle, commonly Urtica dioica subsp gracilis or closely related regional forms. Indigenous peoples across the continent used nettle for food, medicine, and fiber in much the same ways as European cultures. This native nettle offers the same medicinal and nutritional benefits as its European relative, and in many regions it grows just as vigorously.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"American Stinging Nettle On Forest Edge\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230602_202415701-431.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption>American Stinging Nettle On Forest Edge</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Herbalist Rosemary Gladstar writes, “Nettle is one of the most nutritious plants on the planet and an excellent tonic for the whole body” and she notes its long standing role as both food and medicine in traditional herbal systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Identifying Stinging Nettle in the Wild</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Correct identification is essential before gathering seed or working with nettle. Stinging nettle is a perennial herb that can reach three to six feet tall in rich soil. It has opposite leaves that are pointed, serrated along the edges, and covered with fine stinging hairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stems are square and also carry stinging hairs. When brushed against, these hairs inject formic acid and other compounds that cause a temporary burning sensation. This sting is uncomfortable but not dangerous for most people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flowers are small, green, and inconspicuous, forming drooping clusters from the leaf joints. Male and female flowers may appear on the same plant or on separate plants depending on the population. Seeds form in late summer to early fall, turning from green to pale brown as they mature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both European and North American nettles look and behave very similarly. Habitat is also a strong clue. Nettles prefer moist, nitrogen rich soils and often grow near human activity, old barns, compost areas, and waterways.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why Grow Stinging Nettle at Home</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>From a homesteader and herbalist point of view, stinging nettle earns its place quickly. It is productive, resilient, and useful in many different ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a food plant, nettle is exceptionally rich in minerals like iron, calcium, magnesium, and silica, as well as vitamins A, C, and K. Once cooked or dried, the sting disappears completely, leaving a mild green flavor similar to spinach. Nettles can be used in soups, pestos, sautés, teas, and broths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medicinally, nettle is used as a nourishing tonic, allergy support, blood builder, and general restorative. Clinical herbalist David Hoffmann notes, “Nettle provides a rich source of minerals and vitamins and is particularly supportive to people with chronic fatigue or deficiency conditions.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the garden, nettle shines as a fertility plant. Fresh nettle makes one of the best fermented plant fertilizers available. A simple nettle tea or fermented plant juice adds nitrogen, trace minerals, and growth stimulating compounds to garden soil. Many growers swear by nettle feed for leafy crops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nettle can also be used as mulch, compost activator, and ingredient in biodynamic style preparations. Its deep roots draw nutrients upward, making those nutrients available to surrounding plants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond utility, there is real satisfaction in growing a plant that feeds both people and soil. Once established, a small nettle patch can supply food, medicine, and garden fertility for years with very little input.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>European and North American Nettles</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The European stinging nettle, Urtica dioica, is widely cultivated and studied. It has been naturalized in many parts of North America and behaves similarly to the native forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>North America’s native stinging nettle is every bit as valuable. It offers the same nutritional profile, medicinal actions, and gardening benefits. In many regions it is better adapted to local conditions and supports native insects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a conservation and ecological standpoint, choosing native nettle where possible is a sound choice. That said, both forms are excellent plants, and many gardeners already have one or the other growing nearby.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Gathering Stinging Nettle Seed From the Wild</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the simplest and most rewarding ways to start nettle is by gathering seed yourself. Nettle produces abundant seed, and a small amount goes a long way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seeds are ready when the flower clusters dry and turn pale brown. This usually happens from late summer into early fall. Wearing gloves is helpful, as the plants still sting at this stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><figure>\r\n<img alt=\"American Stinging Nettle Seeds\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230707_163302230-432.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption>American Stinging Nettle Seeds</figcaption>\r\n</figure></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Clip seed heads into a paper bag or basket and allow them to dry further indoors. Once dry, gently rub the seed heads between your hands to release the seeds. Winnow away larger plant material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a naturalist and herbalist perspective, ethical seed gathering matters. Take seed from many plants rather than stripping one patch. Leave plenty behind for wildlife and natural regeneration. Avoid gathering in protected areas or sensitive habitats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saving your own seed costs nothing, builds local resilience, and preserves plants adapted to your specific region. It also deepens your awareness of plant life cycles and seasonal rhythms.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How to Grow Stinging Nettle From Seed</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Growing nettle from seed is straightforward and forgiving. Nettles germinate easily when their basic needs are met.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fresh seed often germinates best, but dried seed will also sprout (stratification). Nettles benefit from a period of cold exposure, which mimics winter conditions. In the below example, I\'ve just used plain garden soil because I had no sand or perlite available (which is the preferred thing to use). This still worked out fine, it helped that it was just stratified outside in the cold.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"Stratifying Stinging Nettle\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20250106_213625686.MP-434.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption>Stratifying Stinging Nettle</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>Seeds can be sown outdoors in fall or early spring, or started indoors and transplanted later. Nettles prefer moist, rich soil and partial sun, though they will tolerate full sun if moisture is adequate. Scatter seeds on the soil surface and press them in lightly. Do not bury them deeply, as they need light to germinate. Keep the soil consistently moist until seedlings appear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once established, nettles spread slowly by rhizomes and will form a patch over time. Choose a location where this is welcome, such as a garden edge or dedicated medicinal bed. The below seedlings were scattered and sprouted, then transplanted and spaced out.</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n<img alt=\"American Stinging Nettle Seedlings\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20240802_165707128.MP-433.jpg\" />\r\n<figcaption>American Stinging Nettle Seedlings</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step by Step Summary for Growing Nettle From Seed</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>Identify healthy stinging nettle plants in late summer</li>\r\n <li>Gather mature seed heads when they turn pale brown</li>\r\n <li>Dry seed heads and separate seeds from plant material</li>\r\n <li>Cold stratify seeds naturally by fall sowing or brief refrigeration</li>\r\n <li>Sow seeds on the soil surface and press in gently</li>\r\n <li>Keep soil moist until germination occurs</li>\r\n <li>Thin seedlings if needed and allow plants to establish</li>\r\n <li>Harvest lightly the first year and more heavily in following seasons</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Harvesting and Using Your Homegrown Nettle</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Young spring leaves are the best for food and medicine. Harvest before flowering for the most tender greens and highest nutrient content. Use gloves or scissors to avoid stings. Leaves can be dried for tea, cooked fresh, or frozen for later use. Older plants can be cut back to encourage fresh growth. For garden use, fresh nettle can be soaked in water to create a strong liquid fertilizer. This fermented plant juice is diluted before use and applied to soil or compost. Nettle roots are harvested in fall and used medicinally, particularly for urinary and prostate support, though this is more common in professional herbal practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Joy and Practicality of Growing Your Own</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a quiet joy in gathering wild seed, tending seedlings, and watching a useful plant take hold. Growing nettle connects daily work with long traditions of self reliance and care for the land. From a practical standpoint, nettle is one of the most cost effective plants you can grow. A single seed gathering trip can provide enough seed for years. Once established, nettle returns every spring without replanting. For those interested in native and medicinal plants, nettle offers a perfect balance of usefulness, ease, and ecological value.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Growing stinging nettle from seed is simple, affordable, and deeply rewarding. Whether you choose the European species or our own North American native, you are cultivating a plant that feeds people, soil, and tradition alike. With a little attention and respect, nettle will give back far more than it asks for.

This article explores how the sting itself can actually become a therapeutic tool.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Stinging Nettle in the Wild</h3>\r\n<p>Stinging nettle, <em>Urtica dioica</em>, is native to Europe and Asia and now grows widely across North America, especially in moist soils, forest edges, streambanks, gardens, and disturbed ground near people. It thrives where soil is rich and nitrogen abundant, which is why it often appears close to long settled human landscapes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nettle grows upright, often three to seven feet tall, with opposite dark green leaves that are sharply toothed and pointed. Fine hollow hairs cover the leaves and stems, delivering an immediate sting when brushed. Greenish flower clusters hang from the leaf axils in early summer, later producing abundant seeds. The sting itself remains the most reliable confirmation.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"American stinging nettle on forest floor\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230812_152728133-436.jpg\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>History of Therapeutic Stinging</h3>\r\n<p>The use of nettle stings for pain relief is known as urtication, and its roots run deep in European folk medicine. Roman soldiers reportedly carried nettle with them to colder regions, flogging their limbs to stimulate warmth and circulation during long campaigns. This practice was later adopted across rural Europe for stiff joints, arthritis, and chronic muscular pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In traditional Western herbalism, urtication wasn\'t viewed as cruel or extreme but as a form of counter stimulation, provoking a short lived irritation to awaken the body’s own healing response. Nicholas Culpeper, the seventeenth century herbalist, wrote that nettle could be used to “draw blood to the place,” easing deeper pain through surface activation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similar ideas appear in Eastern European, Russian, and Indigenous traditions, where nettle was applied externally to rheumatic joints or areas of numbness. These practices weren\'t random folk habits but repeatable methods refined through observation, restraint, and respect for the plant’s power.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What\'s Actually Happening When Nettle Stings</h3>\r\n<p>Modern science has helped clarify what traditional healers already sensed through experience. Nettle trichomes inject a mixture of histamine, acetylcholine, serotonin, and formic acid into the skin. This causes immediate burning, redness, and a rush of blood to the area, followed by a deeper warming sensation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research has shown that nettle sting may interfere with pain signaling. A study published in the <em>Journal of Rheumatology</em> found that topical nettle application reduced pain at the base of the thumb in people with osteoarthritis. Researchers suggested that repeated stimulation may desensitize pain fibers and reduce inflammatory signaling over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Randall Holcombe, one of the study’s authors, noted, “The sting appears to activate pain inhibitory pathways, which may explain why a brief discomfort can lead to longer lasting relief.” This aligns closely with traditional explanations that short pain can interrupt long pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Comparing Nettle Sting to Bee Sting Therapy</h3>\r\n<p>Using nettle sting for pain is often compared to apitherapy, the use of bee stings for arthritis and autoimmune conditions. Both methods rely on controlled inflammation to stimulate healing, and both provoke a strong response from the nervous and immune systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bee venom contains melittin and other peptides that have well documented anti inflammatory effects, but it also carries a significant risk of allergic reaction. Nettle sting, by comparison, is far milder, more accessible, and far less likely to cause severe systemic reactions when used appropriately.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"American stinging nettle leaf\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230728_220522511-437.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>While bee sting therapy often requires trained practitioners and careful screening, nettle urtication has historically been practiced by individuals and families with minimal tools. The approach is similar, but nettle offers a more accessible entry point for people interested in this style of therapeutic stimulation without the same level of risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why Causing Pain Can Reduce Pain</h3>\r\n<p>At first glance, stinging yourself on purpose seems counterintuitive. Yet the body doesn\'t experience pain as a simple on off signal. Pain perception is influenced by context, novelty, and nervous system priority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By introducing a sharp but temporary sensation at the surface, nettle sting can override chronic pain signals coming from deeper tissues. This phenomenon, sometimes called counter irritation, has been used in many healing systems, from mustard plasters to cupping to acupuncture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, the rush of blood and immune activity to the area may help clear inflammatory metabolites and bring nutrients to tissues that have become stagnant. Over repeated sessions, many people report reduced baseline pain and improved mobility.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>An Example of Using Nettle Sting</h3>\r\n<p>Harvest a small amount of fresh nettle from a clean area away from pollution, using gloves. Prepare the area to be treated by washing and drying the skin. When ready, brush the nettle leaves across the area for only a few seconds, using brief contact rather than force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Allow the sting to rise and fade over fifteen to thirty minutes, noticing warmth and reduced deep pain rather than focusing on surface discomfort. Afterward, rinse with cool water or apply a soothing herb such as plantain or calendula. Use no more than once daily on the same area, and often less, allowing the body time to respond.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"media-center\"><img alt=\"American Stinging Nettle\" src=\"/uploads/articles/PXL_20230707_161716286-435.jpg\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<h3>Evidence and Clinical Observations</h3>\r\n<p>While nettle urtication hasn\'t been studied as extensively as pharmaceutical interventions, existing evidence is promising. The <em>Journal of Complementary Therapies in Medicine</em> has reported reduced pain scores in small trials using fresh nettle application for musculoskeletal pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The European Scientific Cooperative on Phytotherapy recognizes nettle leaf and root for inflammatory conditions, primarily in oral forms, but notes that topical use has a long and consistent traditional record. As herbalist David Hoffmann writes, “Nettle works not by suppressing symptoms but by engaging the body’s own regulatory intelligence.”</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Safety Considerations</h3>\r\n<p>Nettle sting shouldn\'t ever be used on broken skin, areas with poor circulation, or by anyone with known severe allergies to plants or a history of anaphylaxis. Avoid use during pregnancy, with autoimmune flare ups, or alongside blood thinning medications without professional guidance. Always test a very small area first, never apply to the face or sensitive areas of the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>Stinging nettle reminds us that healing can be hidden by the intimidating side of some plants. When approached with knowledge and restraint, the sting that once caused avoidance can become a tool for relief, reconnecting people to a long lineage of practical, plant based medicine.

Provided proper drainage, the tree can grow in a variety of soils, but is salt sensitive.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Needles & Branches</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nLong, flexible needles consisting of 5 needles per fascicle. It is the only 5 needled pine in eastern Canada. Weak branches break off easily, contributing to its top-branch dominance on older trees.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cones</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nLong, cylinder cones with splotches of white resin when mature. They also make good fire starters.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Wood</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nThe wood is light weight and easy to work with. It also provides good structure and doesn\'t shrink and swell. Useful for carpenters as well as building homes and outdoor structures. Algonquin park was almost all white pine at one point before early settlers harvested the wood for their ships.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Disease</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nWhite Pine Blister Rust (fungus) affects Eastern White Pine trees mainly in the forest. The Blister Rust needs plants of the genus \'Ribes\' (Currents, Gooseberries) nearby to complete its lifecycle.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Popular Cultivars</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\'Pendula\' - weeping\r\n<li>\'Niagara Falls\' - sprawling\r\n<li>\"Vanderwolf\'s Green Globe\" - globe-shaped\r\n</ul>', 5, '[{\"id\":\"88\",\"ref_id\":\"4\",\"name\":\"eastern-white-pine-trunk-88.jpg\",\"sort_order\":\"0\",\"extension\":\"jpg\",\"tag_name\":null,\"description\":\"Eastern White Pine habit\"},{\"id\":\"89\",\"ref_id\":\"4\",\"name\":\"eastern-white-pine-89.jpg\",\"sort_order\":\"1\",\"extension\":\"jpg\",\"tag_name\":null,\"description\":\"Eastern White Pine habit\"},{\"id\":\"90\",\"ref_id\":\"4\",\"name\":\"eastern-white-pine-forest-90.jpg\",\"sort_order\":\"2\",\"extension\":\"jpg\",\"tag_name\":null,\"description\":\"Eastern White Pine forest\"},{\"id\":\"91\",\"ref_id\":\"4\",\"name\":\"eastern-white-pine-branches-2-91.jpg\",\"sort_order\":\"3\",\"extension\":\"jpg\",\"tag_name\":null,\"description\":\"Eastern White Pine branches\"},{\"id\":\"92\",\"ref_id\":\"4\",\"name\":\"eastern-white-pine-branches-92.jpg\",\"sort_order\":\"4\",\"extension\":\"jpg\",\"tag_name\":\"leaves\",\"description\":\"Eastern White Pine branches\"}]', 1),

Roots let out a chemical called Juglone to deter certain plants, such as those of the nightshade family, form growing near the tree. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Leaves</h3>\r\n<p>Long, compound leaves with 13 - 23 leaflets. Fall colour is not highly regarded, usually yellow, brown, or green. Leaf arrangement is alternate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Nuts</h3>\r\n<p>Edible, roast-able and tasty. Most black walnut trees are planted by squirrels that spread and store the nuts in the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Twigs & Buds</h3>\r\n<p>Unique, hardy bud and leaf scar shape. Twigs are thick and have a chambered pith, which can be seen in cross-section taken length-wise. Distinct ridged and furrowed bark runs along the length of the trunk and continues all the way to the top of the tree.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Wood</h3>\r\n<p>Hard, heavy, strong and rot resistant wood. Highly valued for furniture, flooring, veneer and coffins.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Pests & Disease</h3>\r\n<p>Caterpillars (Fall Webworm) feed on the leaves. Signs of an infestation include large webs on branches that resemble, spider webs. Usually not critical to the health of the tree.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n<p>https://www.hunker.com/13424453/how-to-identify-the-leaves-of-black-walnut-or-pecan</p>', 3, '[{\"id\":\"187\",\"ref_id\":\"91\",\"name\":\"black-walnut-branches4-187.jpg\",\"sort_order\":\"0\",\"extension\":\"jpg\",\"tag_name\":null,\"description\":\"Black Walnut branches\"},{\"id\":\"188\",\"ref_id\":\"91\",\"name\":\"black-walnut-branches5-188.jpg\",\"sort_order\":\"1\",\"extension\":\"jpg\",\"tag_name\":\"leaves\",\"description\":\"Black Walnut leaves\"},{\"id\":\"189\",\"ref_id\":\"91\",\"name\":\"black-walnut-branches6-189.jpg\",\"sort_order\":\"2\",\"extension\":\"jpg\",\"tag_name\":\"habit\",\"description\":\"Black Walnut branches\"},{\"id\":\"190\",\"ref_id\":\"91\",\"name\":\"black-walnut-bark3-190.jpg\",\"sort_order\":\"3\",\"extension\":\"jpg\",\"tag_name\":\"bark\",\"description\":\"Black Walnut trunk\"},{\"id\":\"191\",\"ref_id\":\"91\",\"name\":\"black-walnut-leaves1-191.jpg\",\"sort_order\":\"4\",\"extension\":\"jpg\",\"tag_name\":\"leaves\",\"description\":\"Black Walnut Fall leaves\"},{\"id\":\"192\",\"ref_id\":\"91\",\"name\":\"black-walnut1-192.jpg\",\"sort_order\":\"5\",\"extension\":\"jpg\",\"tag_name\":\"habit\",\"description\":\"Black Walnut Fall\"},{\"id\":\"193\",\"ref_id\":\"91\",\"name\":\"black-walnut-fruit-193.jpg\",\"sort_order\":\"6\",\"extension\":\"jpg\",\"tag_name\":\"fruit\",\"description\":\"Black Walnut fruit\"},{\"id\":\"194\",\"ref_id\":\"91\",\"name\":\"black-walnut-fruit-nuts-194.jpg\",\"sort_order\":\"7\",\"extension\":\"jpg\",\"tag_name\":\"fruit\",\"description\":\"Black Walnut fruit\"},{\"id\":\"195\",\"ref_id\":\"91\",\"name\":\"black-walnut-nuts-195.jpg\",\"sort_order\":\"8\",\"extension\":\"jpg\",\"tag_name\":\"fruit\",\"description\":\"Black Walnut nuts\"},{\"id\":\"196\",\"ref_id\":\"91\",\"name\":\"black-walnut-trunk2-196.jpg\",\"sort_order\":\"9\",\"extension\":\"jpg\",\"tag_name\":\"habit\",\"description\":\"Black Walnut winter\"},{\"id\":\"197\",\"ref_id\":\"91\",\"name\":\"black-walnut-leaf-scar1-197.jpg\",\"sort_order\":\"0\",\"extension\":\"jpg\",\"tag_name\":\"twigs\\/buds\",\"description\":\"Black Walnut Winter buds\"},{\"id\":\"198\",\"ref_id\":\"91\",\"name\":\"black-walnut-leaf-scar2-198.jpg\",\"sort_order\":\"1\",\"extension\":\"jpg\",\"tag_name\":\"twigs\\/buds\",\"description\":\"Black Walnut Winter buds\"},{\"id\":\"199\",\"ref_id\":\"91\",\"name\":\"black-walnut-winter-twigs-buds2-199.jpg\",\"sort_order\":\"2\",\"extension\":\"jpg\",\"tag_name\":\"twigs\\/buds\",\"description\":\"Black Walnut Winter buds\"},{\"id\":\"200\",\"ref_id\":\"91\",\"name\":\"black-walnut-winter-twigs-buds4-200.jpg\",\"sort_order\":\"3\",\"extension\":\"jpg\",\"tag_name\":\"twigs\\/buds\",\"description\":\"Black Walnut Winter buds\"}]', 1),

Its most notable characteristics include shinny, pointed leaves dotted with resin on the undersides. Buds are fragrant and sticky with resin. The young tree bark is greenish brown, turning gray with deep ridges and furrows at maturity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Balsam poplar trees are important in nursing and supporting forest ecology and longevity. As water-loving trees, they maintain riparian areas by stabilizing river banks. Disturbed areas from fire and logging also benefit from the vigorous nursing grown of balsam poplar. This helps to support shade tolerant species like white pine or hemlock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Balsam poplar doesn\'t sucker as easily as trembling or largetooth aspen.

The brilliant red berries and attractive red buds provide winter interest and persist throughout the dormant season.

Flower clusters are white and showy on the outer limits, while inner ones are yellowish and provide true flower function. The shrub is very similar in appearance to the European cranberry viburnum (Viburnum opulus), except for a few small characteristics. Most notably, Viburnum trilobum glands (where the petiole meets the leaf blade) are club-shaped and have stalks. European highbush cranberry leaf glands are more concave and saucer-shaped. Viburnum trilobum berries are also edible compared to the bitter berries of Viburnum opulus. Viburnum trilobum is considered a better planting choice than the European counterpart which is invasive in some areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Highbush cranberry bushes attract many bird species as well as deer, moose, beaver, and squirrels which feed on the berries.\r\nThe fruit is high in vitamin C and a great substitute for cranberries.

It grew up to 115 feet tall with a trunk diameter well over 10 feet. Its range stretched from Georgia to Michigan in the United Stated and Plentiful in South western Ontario. Now most chestnuts are short-lived, less than 33 feet tall, and grow from resprouting at the base (a stress response). They are now rare and endangered in Canada and the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The decline of the American chestnut started with ink disease of the 1800\'s, which killed off the southern portion of the tree\'s range.\r\nThe Fungal pathogen, chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica) then came from Asia in early 20th century, which turned the tree from plentiful to rare. The disease feeds off of the trunk\'s cambium, girdling it and eventually killing the tree. Attempts have been made to locate surviving trees and restore them for over 30 years. Now, after decades of breeding, The American Chestnut Foundation is close to producing blight-resistant specimens to release into the wild. A virus is also being developed using Genetic engineering aiming to infect the chestnut blight fungus in an attempt to stop its spread.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leaves have a distinctive large, bristle-tipped outer edge which resembling saw teeth.

Natively, it grows from southern Ontario to Quebec in Canada, and eastern to central parts of the United States. Bitternut hickory belongs to the \'pecan hickory\' group and is Canada\'s only native member. As a good choice for large landscapes it unfortunately is less chosen as its considered difficult to transplant. These difficulties can, however, be overcome with proper nursery growing techniques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bitternut hickory tolerates many growing conditions including shade, alkalinity, and poor soil but is sensitive to salt. Ideally, it prefers rich, moist, acidic loam soil and full sun. Its habitat includes lowlands to higher elevations often in forests amongst other trees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The shape is round to overarching with delicate twigs. Bitternut can be Identified from other hickories by its distinctive yellow buds provide winter interest. Dark green compound leaves with 7 to 11 leaflets providing nice yellow colour in the fall. Bark is greenish grey and smooth when young becoming scaly with age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tree produces fruit when it reaches 25 to 30 years of age. Heavy productions of nuts subsequently occur every 3 to 5 years dropping late summer to Autumn. The fruit is round with a thin shell and four ridges enclosing a kernel. Nuts are bitter and inedible. \r\nThough they are eaten by wildlife, they are ignored until winter as a last resort for food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strong, hard wood of the bitternut hickory can be use for tool handles and sports equipment. It also burns brightly and leaves little ashes making it ideal for firewood. Bitternut is considered the best hickory when used for smoking meats.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"small-text\">\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Arboretum - University of Guelph.

Over 100 species are native to North America and about 30 to Canada; mostly occurring from southern Ontario eastward. They have Low, wide spreading canopies often with a crooked trunk or multi-stemmed habit. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their habitat consists of forest openings, abandoned areas, along streams, and especially in calcium rich soils. Hawthorns are tolerant and adaptable trees tolerating chalky or clay soils, drought, or over moist areas. Ideally however, they prefer well drained loam that retains moisture. Pollution resistance and attractive features makes it a choice tree to plant in cities or industrial areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Branches have thorns, which are typically smooth and very sharp. Leaves are often lobed and or have sharply serrated margins; young leaves are edible. Buds are round, shinny, and reddish-brown.

Small apple-like fruit with thin flesh develop and often persist into winter. These are pomes in type and are often called haws. Their colour is usually red, but can be yellow, orange, blue, or near black. The fruit is an important food source for wildlife, and are dispersed by mammals and birds. They are also edible by humans and can be used to make jams and jellies. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hawthorns have been in North America for a very long time, dating back to the cretaceous period, 140 to 170 million years ago.\r\nThey\'ve been been used medicinally to lower blood pressure by dilating coronary arteries, or as a diuretic to treat congestive heart failure.

It grows in a low spreading habit in open sun; up to 39 feet in height with 1ft trunk diameter, or a shrub in unideal conditions. Pin cherry is a \'pioneer species\', good for initial colonization - the first phase of forest succession. It forms thickets after fire or disturbance clears the ground cover and creates open areas of full sun. These include abandoned pastures, logging sites, and field edges. Pin cherry is short lived (about 40 years), dying off for larger, longer lived forest species to take its place. Tolerant of a variety of soil types and moisture levels, the seeds are viable for 50 - 100 years, and germinate after fire or conditions allow light to hit the soil. Because it grows and suckers quickly the tree is a good soil stabilizer and can be used to prevent erosion. Pin cherry is important to forest cycles and ecosystems but is rarely used for landscaping because of pest, disease, and its short lifespan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leaves are narrowly oval, coming to a sharp point, with finely serrated margins. Leaf colour turns dull purple-red to orange or red, potentially providing nice fall colour. The bark is shinny dark reddish brown with conspicuous horizontal lenticels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flat topped clusters of white blossoms cover the tree in early spring. These are followed by small, bright red fruit ripening late July to early September. The berries are edible but very sour and are a favorite for birds. Pin cherry fruit has been eaten traditionally by first nations people and can be cooked to make excellent preserves. The fruit stones and leaves contain cyanide (toxic) so care should be taken when using it, but the fruit flesh is safe for consumption. </p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"small-text\">\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>British Columbia.

Speckled alder has a symbiotic relationship with soil actinomycetes that can fix nitrogen from the air, helping to enrich the soil around it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The name \'speckled\' comes from white, warty lenticels present on the bark. Leaves appear wrinkled, being sunken at the veins, hence the name rugosa. Leaf undersides are red and hairy; margins are doubly serrated. Purplish brown male catkins and green female catkins appear March to early April, followed by fruiting bodies resembling pine cones. The winged seeds embedded within them attract birds. This restorative, native tree has no serious insect or disease problems except canker, which can possibly be severe.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"small-text\">\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Fire Effects Information System (FEIS).

Its also slightly smaller (60 feet, but occasionally 100 feet) and lives generally farther northward than black walnut. The Crown is broad and irregular in outline and rounded at the top. A low branching trunk with large forked branches appear to droop and curve up at the ends. Butternut grows in moist, well drained soil and intolerant of shade</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The leaves are compound and up to 20 inches long, with oblong to lanceolate leaflets, 11 to 17 in number. Leaf color is yellowish green and hairy underneath (unlike the black walnut). One identifying feature of the tree is the dark brown chambers seen in twig piths when split open. From May to June, yellowish green male drooping catkins, and short female flower spikes occur. The fruit consists of clusters of indehiscent green oval husks which mature in the fall. A single Nut exist within the husk and is encased in a tough shell with a small edible kernel inside. The taste is quite favorable and has a buttery oil, hence the name \'butternut\'. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sap of the butternut tree can be boiled down into a syrup. Currently, the nuts are popular for making maple-butternut candy amongst other snacks. Other uses include a yellowish orange dye which can be made from the nut husks. The root cambium can also be used medicinally. Transplanting can be tricky for butternut as with other walnut trees due to the long taproot, but possible with proper growing techniques. As with the black walnut, the tree produces juglones, which inhibits the growth of some other plants surrounding it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"small-text\">\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.

The Stems are thick, and twig piths are wide and pink to brown in colour. Bark on semi-mature branches are rough, flaky and scaly.

Large, dark, bean-like seed pods follow flowering, containing 5 to 7 seeds which persist into winter. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The name coffeetree was given by early settlers who would make a crude coffee substitute from them.
